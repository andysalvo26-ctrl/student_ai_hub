# Project Context: Student AI Hub

## Identity

- **Institution:** Penn State Smeal College of Business
- **Partner:** Applied AI Club
- **Audience:** Undergraduate students, faculty
- **Purpose:** Educational resource about AI in business contexts

## Voice

- Calm, clear, student-readable
- Describes rather than instructs
- Makes uncertainty visible ("may," "often," "typically")
- Treats AI as support for human judgment, not replacement

## Constraints

| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| No tool/vendor names | Say "AI tools" not "ChatGPT" |
| Canon-only claims | All facts trace to source materials |
| Human rewrite required | AI drafts, human finalizes |
| Sections stand alone | No cross-references between sections |
| No advice | No "students should" or "best practices" |
| No predictions | No claims about what AI "will" do |

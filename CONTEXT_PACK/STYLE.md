# Style Rules

## Do

- Write in short, clear paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Use plain language an undergraduate can follow
- Describe what AI systems do, not what they "could" or "will" do
- Acknowledge limits, tradeoffs, and uncertainty
- Ground claims in sources or observable patterns
- Let structure do the work (clear headings, logical flow)

## Avoid

- Hype, superlatives ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- Predictions about the future of AI
- Telling readers what to think or do
- Long paragraphs or dense blocks of text
- Jargon without explanation
- Language that sounds like marketing

## Sentence Discipline

| Constraint | Rule |
|------------|------|
| Length | 10-20 words typical, 25 max |
| Periods | Use periods over commas for distinct thoughts |
| Comma chains | Break "A, which B, can C, though D" into separate sentences |

## Patterns to Remove

- Signposting: "more broadly," "it's important to note," "additionally"
- Meta-commentary: "This section will discuss," "As we've seen"
- Over-explanation: "In other words," "To put it simply"

## Paragraph Endings

- Vary endings (don't end every paragraph with "in this field")
- No summary statements at section ends
- Last paragraph is just the last point, not a wrap-up

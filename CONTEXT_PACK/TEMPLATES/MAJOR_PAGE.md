# Major Page Template

Use this structure for all "AI in [Major]" pages.

---

## Section 1: AI in [Major Name]

2-3 paragraphs. Brief overview connecting AI to the major's core concerns.

**Pattern:** Pressure-before-technology
- Start with the field's problems/concerns
- Then connect AI as appearing in contexts addressing those problems

---

## Section 2: Where AI Appears

Specific contexts where AI appears in this field.

**Structure:**
- Opening: Direct statement about contexts
- Body: Each context gets its own paragraph (2-3 sentences)
- No closing summary

---

## Section 3: What AI Is Expected to Do

Functional description of AI's role.

**Structure:**
- Opening: Clear statement about AI's role
- Body: Specific capabilities, one per paragraph (2-3 sentences)
- No closing summary

---

## Section 4: Limits and Common Misunderstandings

Discipline-native limitations (not generic AI problems).

**Pattern:** Each limitation connects to:
- The discipline's specific concerns
- How the discipline uses information
- What the discipline requires for accuracy/trust

**Avoid:** "AI hallucinates" (generic) → Instead: "In [major] contexts, AI may produce [field-specific problem]"

---

## Section 5: Key Considerations

Important points reframed as considerations (NOT a summary).

**Pattern:** "In [major], [consideration] matters because [discipline-specific reason]"

**Avoid:**
- "As we've seen..."
- Recapping previous sections
- Summary statements

# Student AI Hub — Parent Repository

This repository contains the Student AI Hub project, organized into two main subprojects: the foundation (frozen methodology and reference materials) and the hub (future scaling layer).

## Repository Structure

- **`foundation/`** — The frozen foundation build repository. Contains the documented methodology, scripts, source registry, and five locked reference sections that establish the credibility and audit trail for the Student AI Hub.

- **`hub/`** — The scaling layer (not yet implemented). This directory will contain future extensions to the Student AI Hub, including expanded content, website infrastructure, and additional workflows. It does not replace the foundation.

- **`shared/`** — Optional shared assets that may be used by both foundation and hub subprojects.

## Where to Start

For reviewers, administrators, and anyone seeking an overview of the foundation:

**Start here**: [`foundation/docs/00_briefing_packet/01_overview/FOUNDATION_BRIEFING.pdf`](foundation/docs/00_briefing_packet/01_overview/FOUNDATION_BRIEFING.pdf)

This PDF provides a complete overview of what the foundation represents, how it was built, and what materials are available.

## Foundation Overview

The `foundation/` directory contains:

- Five locked reference sections (AI Basics, Using AI for School and Work, How Businesses Are Using AI, AI Tools You Might Use, Rules, Risks, and Ethics of AI)
- A documented build process from source selection through content drafting and review
- A human-curated source registry
- Scripts for ingestion, indexing, chunking, and search
- Process documentation and audit materials

See [`foundation/README.md`](foundation/README.md) for details.

## Hub Overview

The `hub/` directory is reserved for future scaling work. It may include:

- Website infrastructure
- Expanded content sections
- Additional workflows and tools
- Integration with the foundation materials

See [`hub/README.md`](hub/README.md) for details.

## Important Notes

- The foundation is frozen and represents the initial build methodology. It should not be modified without explicit review.
- The hub is separate from the foundation and does not replace it. Future work in `hub/` may reference or build upon foundation materials but operates independently.
- All credibility, audit trail, and methodology documentation resides in `foundation/`.

# Human-Authored Pages Boundary

This document explains the distinction between foundation reference sections and human-authored pages in the Student AI Hub website.

## Foundation Reference Sections

The foundation contains five locked reference sections:
- AI Basics
- Using AI for School and Work
- How Businesses Are Using AI
- AI Tools You Might Use
- Rules, Risks, and Ethics of AI

These sections are derived from approved sources, reviewed, and finalized. They serve as canonical reference material. Content for these pages comes from the canonical pack pillar files (`PILLAR_*.md`).

## Human-Authored Pages

The foundation also identifies three sections that are human-authored:
- AI News That Matters
- AI Resources at Penn State
- AI by Smeal Major

These pages are:
- Created and maintained by humans
- Updated more frequently than foundation reference sections
- Not derived from the canonical pack
- Not subject to the same source approval process as foundation sections

## How ChatGPT Should Handle Human-Authored Pages

When asked about human-authored pages:

1. **Acknowledge the boundary**: "This section is human-authored and updated separately from the foundation reference sections."

2. **Defer to humans**: "Content for this section would be created and maintained by humans, not derived from the canonical pack."

3. **Do not invent**: Do not create content for human-authored pages using canonical pack materials. These pages have different purposes and may include information not in the foundation.

4. **Suggest structure only**: If asked to help plan human-authored pages, focus on structure and organization, not content. For example: "This page could include recent news items, organized by date or topic."

## Labeling and Separation

On the website, human-authored pages should be:
- Clearly labeled as separate from foundation reference sections
- Visually distinct if possible (different section, sidebar note, or header)
- Updated independently without affecting foundation content

## Frequency of Updates

- **Foundation reference sections**: Locked and represent the state of information at the time they were created
- **Human-authored pages**: Updated more frequently as new information becomes available

This difference in update frequency is intentional and reflects different purposes.

## What This Means for Website Building

When building the Student AI Hub website:
- Use canonical pack content for the five foundation reference sections
- Plan space and structure for human-authored pages, but do not populate them with canonical pack content
- Clearly distinguish between the two types of pages
- Ensure human-authored pages can be updated without modifying foundation content

## ChatGPT Guidance

If asked to create content for human-authored pages:
- Decline to use canonical pack materials
- Explain that these pages are human-authored
- Suggest that humans create this content separately
- Offer to help with structure or organization only, not content

**Note**: This boundary is established by the foundation. The canonical pack does not create this distinction; it reflects what the foundation has already established.

# Site Structure Options

This document provides simple navigation options for organizing the Student AI Hub website. Choose a structure that fits your platform and user needs.

## Option 1: Simple Linear Structure

**Navigation**: Single-level menu with five main sections

**Pages**:
- AI Basics → `PILLAR_AI_BASICS.md`
- Using AI for School and Work → `PILLAR_USING_AI_FOR_SCHOOL_AND_WORK.md`
- How Businesses Use AI → `PILLAR_HOW_BUSINESSES_USE_AI.md`
- AI Tools You Might Use → `PILLAR_AI_TOOLS_YOU_MIGHT_USE.md`
- Rules, Risks, and Ethics → `PILLAR_RULES_RISKS_AND_ETHICS.md`

**Additional pages**:
- Glossary → `GLOSSARY.md`
- FAQ → `FAQ_STUDENTS.md` and `FAQ_BUSINESS_CONTEXT.md`

**Pros**: Simple, easy to navigate, clear structure
**Cons**: May not scale well if adding many new sections

## Option 2: Hub and Spoke Structure

**Navigation**: Home page with five pillar sections, plus supporting resources

**Home page**: Overview linking to all pillars

**Pillar pages** (same as Option 1):
- AI Basics → `PILLAR_AI_BASICS.md`
- Using AI for School and Work → `PILLAR_USING_AI_FOR_SCHOOL_AND_WORK.md`
- How Businesses Use AI → `PILLAR_HOW_BUSINESSES_USE_AI.md`
- AI Tools You Might Use → `PILLAR_AI_TOOLS_YOU_MIGHT_USE.md`
- Rules, Risks, and Ethics → `PILLAR_RULES_RISKS_AND_ETHICS.md`

**Resources section**:
- Glossary → `GLOSSARY.md`
- FAQ for Students → `FAQ_STUDENTS.md`
- FAQ: Business Context → `FAQ_BUSINESS_CONTEXT.md`
- Decision Checklist → `DECISION_CHECKLIST.md`
- Risk Checklist → `RISK_CHECKLIST.md`

**Pros**: Clear separation between main content and supporting resources
**Cons**: Requires more navigation clicks

## Option 3: Topic-Based Structure

**Navigation**: Grouped by user needs

**For Students**:
- AI Basics → `PILLAR_AI_BASICS.md`
- Using AI for School and Work → `PILLAR_USING_AI_FOR_SCHOOL_AND_WORK.md`
- AI Tools You Might Use → `PILLAR_AI_TOOLS_YOU_MIGHT_USE.md`
- FAQ for Students → `FAQ_STUDENTS.md`
- Decision Checklist → `DECISION_CHECKLIST.md`

**For Business Context**:
- How Businesses Use AI → `PILLAR_HOW_BUSINESSES_USE_AI.md`
- FAQ: Business Context → `FAQ_BUSINESS_CONTEXT.md`

**Understanding Risks**:
- Rules, Risks, and Ethics → `PILLAR_RULES_RISKS_AND_ETHICS.md`
- Risk Checklist → `RISK_CHECKLIST.md`

**Reference**:
- Glossary → `GLOSSARY.md`

**Pros**: Organized by user needs, may be more intuitive
**Cons**: Some content appears in multiple categories

## Mapping Canonical Files to Pages

Each pillar file (`PILLAR_*.md`) maps directly to a main content page. Module files (`GLOSSARY.md`, `FAQ_*.md`, `*_CHECKLIST.md`) can be standalone pages or integrated into pillar pages as appropriate.

## Human-Authored Pages

Remember that some pages are human-authored and updated more frequently:
- AI News That Matters
- AI Resources at Penn State
- AI by Smeal Major

These should be clearly labeled and kept separate from foundation reference sections.

## Don't Invent

When building pages, use content from the canonical pack files. Do not invent new facts, add information not in the foundation, or create content that goes beyond what the foundation materials provide.

# Intent and Scope

## Purpose of AI Assistance

The purpose of AI assistance in drafting "AI by Smeal Major" pages is to:
- Support drafting and clarity
- Help explain concepts from the canonical packs
- Assist with rephrasing and connecting ideas
- Maintain consistency with established content frameworks

## Scope of Allowed Assistance

The AI assistant may:
- Help explain concepts from PackA (general AI concepts) and PackB (major descriptions)
- Rephrase content for clarity while maintaining faithfulness to source materials
- Connect ideas between the canonical packs and the page structure
- Suggest organizational approaches that align with the shell template
- Assist with maintaining institutional tone and descriptive language

## Explicit Exclusions

The AI assistant does not:
- Decide what content should be included or excluded
- Make policy determinations
- Provide instructional guidance to students
- Substitute for faculty or institutional authority
- Introduce facts, statistics, or claims not supported by PackA or PackB
- Provide recommendations, advice, or "best practices" to students
- Mention specific tools, platforms, or vendors

## Important Boundaries

**This is not instructional guidance to students.** The pages describe how AI relates to majors; they do not instruct students on how to use AI.

**This is not a substitute for faculty or institutional authority.** The AI assistant supports human authors who have the expertise and authority to create appropriate content.

**The human author is responsible for all content decisions.** The assistant's role is supportive, not authoritative.

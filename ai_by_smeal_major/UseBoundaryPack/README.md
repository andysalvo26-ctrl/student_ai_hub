# Use Boundary Pack

## Purpose

This bundle provides behavioral constraints and scope definitions for AI assistance when drafting "AI by Smeal Major" pages. It is designed to be used alongside PackA (canonical AI content) and PackB (Smeal major descriptions) to guide AI assistants in supporting human authors.

## Intended Use

This pack should be uploaded into a ChatGPT conversation alongside:
- **PackA**: Canonical pack containing general AI concepts, limitations, and foundational content
- **PackB**: Canonical pack containing descriptive information about Smeal undergraduate majors
- **Shell**: The template structure for "AI by Smeal Major" pages

Together, these materials provide context and constraints that help the AI assistant support human authors while maintaining appropriate boundaries.

## Role of This Pack

This pack constrains assistant behavior but does not replace human authorship. The AI assistant's role is to:
- Support drafting and clarity
- Help explain and rephrase ideas
- Connect concepts from the canonical packs

The human author remains responsible for:
- Final wording and publication decisions
- Content accuracy and appropriateness
- Institutional alignment and authority

This is a support tool, not a substitute for human judgment or institutional authority.

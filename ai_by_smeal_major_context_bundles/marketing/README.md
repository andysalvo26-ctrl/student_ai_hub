# Context Bundle: Marketing

This folder contains context materials for drafting the "AI in Marketing" page for the Smeal College of Business website.

## How to Use This Bundle

**Before dragging this folder into ChatGPT:**

1. **First, drag** `ai_by_smeal_major_system/CHATGPT_STARTER_CONTEXT.md` into your ChatGPT thread. This file contains all the rules, constraints, and style requirements.

2. **Then attach** `AI by Smeal Major.pdf` (if available) as the style witness with completed examples.

3. **Then drag this entire folder** into the ChatGPT thread.

**Drafting process:**

- Draft **one section at a time** using the prompts in `SECTION_PROMPTS.md`
- Review each section draft before proceeding to the next
- Content must be **descriptive, not instructional**
- **Human rewriting is required** before freezing any text
- Wait for explicit approval before moving to the next section

## Contents

- `MAJOR_CANON.md` - Canonical descriptive information about Marketing (source of truth)
- `SHELL.md` - Section headings and structure
- `SECTION_PROMPTS.md` - Copy-paste prompts for Sections 2-5
- `BUNDLE_BOUNDARIES.md` - Quick reminder of constraints

## Important

- Do NOT copy `CHATGPT_STARTER_CONTEXT.md` into this bundle. Reference it from the system folder.
- All content must trace to `MAJOR_CANON.md` and PackA (AI concepts).
- No recommendations, no tools/vendors, descriptive only.

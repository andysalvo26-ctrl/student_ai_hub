# Section Prompt Templates

## How to Use

Copy and paste the appropriate prompt for the section you're drafting. Replace `[MAJOR]` with the actual major name (e.g., "Finance", "Marketing").

## Section 1: AI in [MAJOR]

**Do not use a prompt for Section 1.** The human author typically writes this section directly or provides specific guidance. If you must generate it, use the general drafting instructions from `CHATGPT_STARTER_CONTEXT.md`.

## Section 2: Where AI Appears in This Field

```
Generate Section 2: Where AI Appears in [MAJOR]

Follow these requirements:

1. **Structure**: Start with a direct statement about contexts where AI appears. Then provide specific contexts, each in its own paragraph (2-3 sentences each). End with the last context窶馬o closing summary.

2. **Pressure-Before-Technology Pattern**: Start with [MAJOR]'s core concerns from the major canon. Then describe where AI appears in contexts addressing those concerns. Not "AI tools exist, here's where [MAJOR] uses them" but "[MAJOR] deals with X, AI appears in contexts addressing X."

3. **Discourse Framing**: Frame as "how AI relates to [MAJOR]" not "what AI does generically." Every statement must connect to [MAJOR]'s specific concerns from the major canon.

4. **Major-Specific Anchoring**: Every context must be specific to [MAJOR]. No generic statements. Reference the major canon to identify field-specific contexts.

5. **Sentence Discipline**: 
   - Short to medium sentences (10-20 words typical)
   - No comma chains (break complex ideas into multiple sentences)
   - No signposting phrases ("more broadly," "additionally," "it's important to note")
   - Vary paragraph endings (don't end every paragraph with "in [MAJOR]")

6. **No Conclusions**: End with the last context. No summary statement, no "in conclusion."

7. **Canon Only**: Use PackA for AI concepts, PackB/[MAJOR] canon for major-specific context. No unsupported claims.

8. **Descriptive, Not Instructional**: Describe contexts where AI appears. No "students should" or recommendations.

9. **No Tools/Vendors**: Refer generically to "AI tools," "AI systems," "AI applications." No specific tool names.

Mark output as: **[DRAFT - Requires Human Review]**

## Section 3: What AI Is Expected to Do

```
Generate Section 3: What AI Is Expected to Do in [MAJOR]

Follow these requirements:

1. **Structure**: Start with a clear statement about AI's role in [MAJOR]. Then describe specific capabilities or functions, one per paragraph (2-3 sentences each). End with the last capability窶馬o closing summary.

2. **Discourse Framing**: Frame as "what AI is expected to do in [MAJOR] contexts" not "what AI does generically." Every capability must connect to [MAJOR]'s specific concerns from the major canon.

3. **Functional Description**: Describe AI's role and capabilities. Not promises or guarantees, but functional expectations based on how [MAJOR] uses AI.

4. **Major-Specific Anchoring**: Every capability must be specific to [MAJOR]. Reference the major canon to identify field-specific expectations. No generic AI capabilities.

5. **Sentence Discipline**: 
   - Short to medium sentences (10-20 words typical)
   - No comma chains (break complex ideas into multiple sentences)
   - No signposting phrases ("more broadly," "additionally," "it's important to note")
   - Vary paragraph endings

6. **No Conclusions**: End with the last capability. No summary statement.

7. **Canon Only**: Use PackA for AI concepts, PackB/[MAJOR] canon for major-specific context. No unsupported claims.

8. **Descriptive, Not Instructional**: Describe what AI is expected to do. No "students should" or recommendations.

9. **No Tools/Vendors**: Refer generically to "AI tools," "AI systems," "AI applications." No specific tool names.

```
Generate Section 4: Limits and Common Misunderstandings in [MAJOR]

2. **Field-Native Limits**: Limitations must be specific to how [MAJOR] uses AI, rooted in discipline logic. Not generic AI problems ("AI has hallucinations") but field-specific concerns ("In [MAJOR] contexts, AI tools may produce [field-specific problem] that appears [field-specific concern]").

3. **Discipline Logic**: Each limitation must connect to:
   - [MAJOR]'s specific concerns from the major canon
   - How [MAJOR] uses information
   - What [MAJOR] requires for accuracy/trust

4. **Major-Specific Anchoring**: Every limitation must be specific to [MAJOR]. Reference the major canon to identify discipline-specific concerns. No generic AI limitations.

5. **Sentence Discipline**: 
   - Short to medium sentences (10-20 words typical)
   - No comma chains (break complex ideas into multiple sentences)
   - No signposting phrases ("more broadly," "additionally," "it's important to note")
   - Vary paragraph endings

# Provenance — Where Authority Comes From

## Source of authority

All authority and factual claims in this canonical pack come from the foundation repository. This pack does not create new facts or make new claims. It organizes and references information that already exists in the foundation.

## Foundation repository

The foundation repository (`foundation/`) contains:
- The documented process used to build the Student AI Hub foundation
- Five locked reference sections
- The source registry and audit materials
- Process documentation explaining how the foundation was created

## Entry points to the foundation

To understand the foundation's authority, start with:
- `foundation/FOUNDATION_OVERVIEW.md` (or PDF) — Overview of what the foundation represents
- `foundation/docs/00_briefing_packet/01_overview/FOUNDATION_BRIEFING.pdf` — Detailed briefing document

These documents establish the factual basis for everything referenced in this canonical pack.

## How canonical files reference foundation materials

When canonical files in this pack reference foundation materials, they:
- Point explicitly to foundation documents using paths like `foundation/content/sections/ai-basics/index.md`
- Quote or summarize accurately without adding interpretation
- Include a metadata header listing all foundation files used
- Make clear that authority comes from the foundation

## Tracing statements back to foundation

Every statement in this canonical pack can be traced back to a foundation document. Each canonical file includes a `derived_from` list in its metadata header showing exactly which foundation files were used to create it.

## Purpose

This provenance document helps ensure that anyone using this canonical pack understands that it references the foundation, not replaces it. All factual authority flows from the foundation repository.

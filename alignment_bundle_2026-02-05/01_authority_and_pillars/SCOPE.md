# Scope — Canonical Knowledge Pack

## What belongs here

- Summaries of foundation materials that help ChatGPT understand the Student AI Hub
- References to foundation documents, organized for easy lookup
- Explanations of foundation standards and processes, written in plain language
- Context about how the foundation was built, without technical details
- Guidance on how canonical files should reference foundation materials

## What does not belong here

- New factual claims about AI, students, or the hub
- Original content that does not reference the foundation
- Technical documentation or code
- Promises about future features or capabilities
- Claims about reliability, accuracy, or trustworthiness
- Platform-specific implementation steps (Wix, SharePoint, etc.)

## Important note

If new factual claims need to be added to the Student AI Hub, those changes must be made in the foundation repository first. This canonical pack references the foundation; it does not introduce new facts. Any new information must be added to the foundation through its documented processes before it can be referenced here.

## New sources

New sources go to the foundation repository (as a new version), not to this canonical pack. This pack only references sources that are already documented in the foundation.

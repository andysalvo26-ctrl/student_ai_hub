# Decision Checklist: Using AI for Academic Work

Use these questions to guide decisions about whether and how to use AI tools for coursework and academic tasks.

## Before Using AI

- Have you checked your syllabus or assignment instructions for guidance on AI use?
- Have you asked your instructor if you're unsure about whether AI use is allowed?
- Do you understand what your instructor expects regarding AI use for this specific assignment?
- Have you considered whether AI use will facilitate or take away opportunities for deeper learning?

## When Selecting AI Tools

- Are you using a publicly available tool or an institutionally licensed tool?
- Does the tool require confidential or sensitive information? (Public tools may not be appropriate.)
- Have you checked your institution's guidelines about what types of data can be entered into different AI tools?
- Are you aware of the tool's limitations, including potential for incorrect information, bias, or misattributed sources?

## While Using AI

- Are you using AI to generate ideas or as a learning tool, rather than to complete assignments?
- Are you thinking critically about the AI output rather than accepting it uncritically?
- Are you verifying information provided by AI tools through other sources?
- Are you engaging directly with source material, not just relying on AI summaries?

## After Using AI

- Have you documented how and when you used AI tools?
- Have you cited AI-generated content according to your instructor's expectations?
- Have you disclosed your AI use as required by your institution's policies?
- Have you reviewed the AI output for accuracy, bias, and completeness?

## For Study and Productivity

- Are you using effective learning strategies that involve thinking deeply about material?
- Are you comparing and contrasting concepts, explaining in your own words, or self-quizzing?
- Are you avoiding delegating your learning process entirely to an AI tool?
- Have you considered whether AI use removes opportunities to engage directly with course material?

## When Unsure

- Have you asked your instructor for clarification?
- Have you consulted your institution's academic integrity policies?
- Have you considered erring on the side of caution and asking before using?

# Glossary

## A

**Algorithm**: A series of steps that allows a computer to accomplish a certain task. Algorithms are the foundation of all AI tools.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Technology developed with the goal of performing tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as recognizing patterns, making decisions, and communicating. AI refers to the general ability of computers to emulate human thought and perform tasks in real-world environments.

**Artificial Neural Network**: A computational approach that mimics how the human brain processes information, requiring large amounts of data and computational power. Used in deep learning.

## B

**Black Box**: A term used to describe AI systems because of the many, often hidden layers of calculations and decisions that lead to their predictions. The "black box problem" refers to the difficulty understanding why AI systems make certain decisions.

**Bias**: In AI contexts, refers to systematic errors or unfairness in AI systems. AI systems can perpetuate bias and discrimination because they're trained on data that includes problematic content or reflects existing inequities.

## D

**Deep Learning**: An advanced method of machine learning. Deep learning models use large neural networks—networks that function like a human brain to logically analyze data—to learn complex patterns and make predictions independent of human input.

## G

**Generative AI**: AI systems that take in data and use predictive algorithms to create original content, rather than just reacting to data input. Examples include large language models that can generate text, images, or other content.

## H

**Hallucination**: When an AI system produces inaccurate or fabricated information. The system might make up an answer that's not true, or cite sources that don't actually exist. Information is often presented with confidence even when incorrect.

## L

**Large Language Model (LLM)**: Machine learning models designed for natural language processing, particularly language generation. LLMs are trained on vast amounts of human-written text, analyze it to map probabilities underlying human language, and use these models to mimic human communication.

## M

**Machine Learning**: A subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning refers to technologies and algorithms that enable systems to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve themselves through experience and data. Machine learning is a pathway to artificial intelligence.

## N

**Neural Network**: Networks that function like a human brain to logically analyze data. Deep learning uses multilayered neural networks called deep neural networks.

## O

**Opacity**: The problem of AI systems making decisions that are not readily explainable to people. Also called the "black box problem."

## T

**Training Data**: The information a machine learning model is trained on. Training data can include numbers, photos, text, bank transactions, pictures of people, repair records, time series data from sensors, or sales reports.

# Pillar: Using AI for School and Work

## What this covers

- Appropriate uses of AI in coursework and academic settings
- Maintaining academic integrity when using AI tools
- AI as a study and productivity tool
- Common pitfalls and limitations students should understand

## Key ideas

- **Appropriate uses**: Idea generation, clarification of concepts, editing and proofreading, coding assistance, information searching, summarizing documents, creating first drafts, and using AI tutors for explanations.
- **Academic integrity**: Students should determine instructor expectations, seek clarification when needed, document AI use, and cite AI sources properly. Using AI to substantially complete assignments may be prohibited.
- **Transparency**: Proper citation of AI-generated content is important for maintaining transparency and integrity. Students should disclose AI use and follow instructor guidelines.
- **Learning strategies**: The relationship between AI use and learning depends on whether it facilitates or takes away opportunities for deeper learning. Effective strategies involve thinking deeply about material.
- **Study support**: AI can support study practices like previewing readings and generating questions, but students should consider whether this removes opportunities to engage directly with material.

## Common misunderstandings

- **Limitations**: AI tools can produce incorrect information (hallucinations), exhibit bias, and misattribute sources. Not everything AI generates is accurate or useful.
- **Comprehensive support**: While AI can feel life-like, it has serious limitations in providing comprehensive support. Students need to think critically about AI output.
- **Accuracy concerns**: Students express concerns about receiving incorrect information, highlighting the importance of verifying AI-generated content.

## How to use this section

This pillar provides practical guidance for students. Use it when:
- Building a "Using AI for School" or "Academic Integrity" page
- Creating guidance on when and how to use AI tools
- Addressing student questions about AI in coursework
- Explaining institutional expectations and best practices

Emphasize that students should check with instructors and use AI thoughtfully, not as a replacement for learning.

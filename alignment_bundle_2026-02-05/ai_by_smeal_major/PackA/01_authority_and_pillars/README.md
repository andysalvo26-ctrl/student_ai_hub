# Canonical Knowledge Pack

## What this pack is

This pack contains materials that help ChatGPT understand the Student AI Hub foundation when guiding humans in building the Student AI Hub website. These materials provide context about what the hub is, how it was built, and what standards it follows.

## How to use this pack with ChatGPT

This pack is organized into upload batches, each containing 10 or fewer files. Upload one batch at a time to ChatGPT:

- **Batch 01** (`uploads/batch_01_authority_and_pillars/`): Authority documents and the five pillar summaries. Upload this first to establish context.
- **Batch 02** (`uploads/batch_02_modules/`): Cross-cutting modules like glossaries, FAQs, and checklists. Upload after Batch 01.
- **Batch 03** (`uploads/batch_03_site_guidance_optional/`): Site structure and composition guidance. Optional, upload if needed for website planning.

Drag the entire batch folder into ChatGPT's file upload interface. ChatGPT can then reference these materials when providing guidance.

## Relationship to foundation and hub

This pack does not replace or duplicate the foundation repository. It organizes key information from the foundation in a format that helps ChatGPT provide accurate guidance. All authority and factual claims come from the foundation repository (`foundation/`). This pack serves as a reference layer, not a source of new information.

The Student AI Hub website will be built separately. This pack helps ensure website content aligns with what the foundation actually contains.

## What this pack supports

This pack supports website creation by providing clear context. It helps humans and ChatGPT understand:
- What the Student AI Hub foundation represents
- What reference materials exist
- What standards were applied during the foundation build
- How future content relates to the foundation

## What this pack does not do

- This pack does not introduce new facts or claims
- This pack does not replace the foundation repository
- This pack does not automate website creation
- This pack does not make decisions about content or design

Human judgment remains central to all website creation decisions. This pack provides context and reference materials only.

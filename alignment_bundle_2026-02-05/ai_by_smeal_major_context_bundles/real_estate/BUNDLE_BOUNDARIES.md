- **No advice** - No recommendations, guidance, or "best practices"
- **No tools/vendors** - Refer generically to "AI tools," "AI systems"
- **Canon-only** - All claims must trace to MAJOR_CANON.md and PackA
- **No conclusions** - No finalization without human approval

## Tone

- Institutional, descriptive tone

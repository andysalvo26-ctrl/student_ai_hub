## Section 2: Where AI Appears in This Field

```
Generate Section 2: Where AI Appears in Risk Management

Follow these requirements:

1. **Structure**: Start with a direct statement about contexts where AI appears. Then provide specific contexts, each in its own paragraph (2-3 sentences each). End with the last context窶馬o closing summary.

2. **Pressure-Before-Technology Pattern**: Start with Risk Management's core concerns from the major canon. Then describe where AI appears in contexts addressing those concerns. Not "AI tools exist, here's where Risk Management uses them" but "Risk Management deals with X, AI appears in contexts addressing X."

3. **Discourse Framing**: Frame as "how AI relates to Risk Management" not "what AI does generically." Every statement must connect to Risk Management's specific concerns from the major canon.

4. **Major-Specific Anchoring**: Every context must be specific to Risk Management. No generic statements. Reference the major canon to identify field-specific contexts.

5. **Sentence Discipline**: 
   - Short to medium sentences (10-20 words typical)
   - No comma chains (break complex ideas into multiple sentences)
   - No signposting phrases ("more broadly," "additionally," "it's important to note")
   - Vary paragraph endings (don't end every paragraph with "in Risk Management")

6. **No Conclusions**: End with the last context. No summary statement, no "in conclusion."

7. **Canon Only**: Use PackA for AI concepts, this MAJOR_CANON.md for Risk Management-specific context. No unsupported claims.

8. **Descriptive, Not Instructional**: Describe contexts where AI appears. No "students should" or recommendations.

9. **No Tools/Vendors**: Refer generically to "AI tools," "AI systems," "AI applications." No specific tool names.

Mark output as: **[DRAFT - Requires Human Review]**

```
Generate Section 3: What AI Is Expected to Do in Risk Management

Follow these requirements:

2. **Discourse Framing**: Frame as "what AI is expected to do in Risk Management contexts" not "what AI does generically." Every capability must connect to Risk Management's specific concerns from the major canon.

3. **Functional Description**: Describe AI's role and capabilities. Not promises or guarantees, but functional expectations based on how Risk Management uses AI.

2. **Field-Native Limits**: Limitations must be specific to how Risk Management uses AI, rooted in discipline logic. Not generic AI problems ("AI has hallucinations") but field-specific concerns ("In Risk Management contexts, AI tools may produce [field-specific problem] that appears [field-specific concern]").

3. **Discipline Logic**: Each limitation must connect to:
   - Risk Management's specific concerns from the major canon
   - How Risk Management uses information
   - What Risk Management requires for accuracy/trust

4. **Major-Specific Anchoring**: Every limitation must be specific to Risk Management. Reference the major canon to identify discipline-specific concerns. No generic AI limitations.

5. **Sentence Discipline**: 
   - Short to medium sentences (10-20 words typical)

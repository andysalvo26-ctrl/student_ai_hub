Copy and paste these prompts into ChatGPT, replacing `[MAJOR]` with "Supply Chain and Information Systems" if needed.

## Section 2: Where AI Appears in This Field

```
Generate Section 2: Where AI Appears in Supply Chain and Information Systems

Follow these requirements:

1. **Structure**: Start with a direct statement about contexts where AI appears. Then provide specific contexts, each in its own paragraph (2-3 sentences each). End with the last context窶馬o closing summary.

2. **Pressure-Before-Technology Pattern**: Start with Supply Chain and Information Systems's core concerns from the major canon. Then describe where AI appears in contexts addressing those concerns. Not "AI tools exist, here's where Supply Chain and Information Systems uses them" but "Supply Chain and Information Systems deals with X, AI appears in contexts addressing X."

3. **Discourse Framing**: Frame as "how AI relates to Supply Chain and Information Systems" not "what AI does generically." Every statement must connect to Supply Chain and Information Systems's specific concerns from the major canon.

4. **Major-Specific Anchoring**: Every context must be specific to Supply Chain and Information Systems. No generic statements. Reference the major canon to identify field-specific contexts.

5. **Sentence Discipline**: 
   - Short to medium sentences (10-20 words typical)
   - No comma chains (break complex ideas into multiple sentences)
   - No signposting phrases ("more broadly," "additionally," "it's important to note")
   - Vary paragraph endings (don't end every paragraph with "in Supply Chain and Information Systems")

6. **No Conclusions**: End with the last context. No summary statement, no "in conclusion."

7. **Canon Only**: Use PackA for AI concepts, this MAJOR_CANON.md for Supply Chain and Information Systems-specific context. No unsupported claims.

8. **Descriptive, Not Instructional**: Describe contexts where AI appears. No "students should" or recommendations.

9. **No Tools/Vendors**: Refer generically to "AI tools," "AI systems," "AI applications." No specific tool names.

Mark output as: **[DRAFT - Requires Human Review]**

## Section 3: What AI Is Expected to Do

```
Generate Section 3: What AI Is Expected to Do in Supply Chain and Information Systems

Follow these requirements:

1. **Structure**: Start with a clear statement about AI's role in Supply Chain and Information Systems. Then describe specific capabilities or functions, one per paragraph (2-3 sentences each). End with the last capability窶馬o closing summary.

2. **Discourse Framing**: Frame as "what AI is expected to do in Supply Chain and Information Systems contexts" not "what AI does generically." Every capability must connect to Supply Chain and Information Systems's specific concerns from the major canon.

3. **Functional Description**: Describe AI's role and capabilities. Not promises or guarantees, but functional expectations based on how Supply Chain and Information Systems uses AI.

4. **Major-Specific Anchoring**: Every capability must be specific to Supply Chain and Information Systems. Reference the major canon to identify field-specific expectations. No generic AI capabilities.

5. **Sentence Discipline**: 
   - Short to medium sentences (10-20 words typical)
   - No comma chains (break complex ideas into multiple sentences)
   - No signposting phrases ("more broadly," "additionally," "it's important to note")
   - Vary paragraph endings

6. **No Conclusions**: End with the last capability. No summary statement.

7. **Canon Only**: Use PackA for AI concepts, this MAJOR_CANON.md for Supply Chain and Information Systems-specific context. No unsupported claims.

8. **Descriptive, Not Instructional**: Describe what AI is expected to do. No "students should" or recommendations.

9. **No Tools/Vendors**: Refer generically to "AI tools," "AI systems," "AI applications." No specific tool names.

## Section 4: Limits and Common Misunderstandings

```
Generate Section 4: Limits and Common Misunderstandings in Supply Chain and Information Systems

Follow these requirements:

1. **Structure**: Start by acknowledging limitations exist. Then describe specific limitations, each in its own paragraph (2-3 sentences each), rooted in discipline logic. End with the last limitation窶馬o closing summary.

2. **Field-Native Limits**: Limitations must be specific to how Supply Chain and Information Systems uses AI, rooted in discipline logic. Not generic AI problems ("AI has hallucinations") but field-specific concerns ("In Supply Chain and Information Systems contexts, AI tools may produce [field-specific problem] that appears [field-specific concern]").

3. **Discipline Logic**: Each limitation must connect to:
   - Supply Chain and Information Systems's specific concerns from the major canon
   - How Supply Chain and Information Systems uses information
   - What Supply Chain and Information Systems requires for accuracy/trust

4. **Major-Specific Anchoring**: Every limitation must be specific to Supply Chain and Information Systems. Reference the major canon to identify discipline-specific concerns. No generic AI limitations.

5. **Sentence Discipline**: 
   - Short to medium sentences (10-20 words typical)
   - No comma chains (break complex ideas into multiple sentences)
   - No signposting phrases ("more broadly," "additionally," "it's important to note")
   - Vary paragraph endings

6. **No Conclusions**: End with the last limitation. No summary statement.

7. **Canon Only**: Use PackA for AI concepts, this MAJOR_CANON.md for Supply Chain and Information Systems-specific context. No unsupported claims.

8. **Descriptive, Not Instructional**: Describe limitations. No "students should" or recommendations.

9. **No Tools/Vendors**: Refer generically to "AI tools," "AI systems," "AI applications." No specific tool names.

## Section 5: Key Considerations for This Discipline

```
Generate Section 5: Key Considerations for Supply Chain and Information Systems

Follow these requirements:

1. **Structure**: Start by noting considerations exist (not "summary"). Then reframe important points as considerations, each in its own paragraph (2-3 sentences each). End with the last consideration窶馬o closing summary.

2. **Reframing, Not Summary**: This section does NOT summarize previous sections. It reframes important points as considerations for Supply Chain and Information Systems. Pattern: "In Supply Chain and Information Systems, [consideration] matters because [discipline-specific reason]."

3. **Discipline-Specific Reasons**: Each consideration must connect to Supply Chain and Information Systems's specific concerns from the major canon. Not generic considerations but field-specific ones.

4. **Major-Specific Anchoring**: Every consideration must be specific to Supply Chain and Information Systems. Reference the major canon to identify discipline-specific concerns. No generic considerations.

5. **Sentence Discipline**: 
   - Short to medium sentences (10-20 words typical)
   - No comma chains (break complex ideas into multiple sentences)

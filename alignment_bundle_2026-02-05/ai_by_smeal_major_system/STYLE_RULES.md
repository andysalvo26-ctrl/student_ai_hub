# Style Rules: Inferred from Structure and Constraints

## Source of Rules

These rules are extracted from:
- Completed examples in `AI by Smeal Major.pdf` (Accounting, Actuarial Science, Corporate Innovation and Entrepreneurship)
- PackA's institutional, descriptive tone
- PackB's neutral major descriptions
- UseBoundaryPack constraints (no recommendations, no tools)
- Shell structure (5 distinct sections with specific purposes)

**Note**: See `WITNESS_RULES.md` for detailed patterns extracted from the PDF examples.

## Core Style Principles

### 1. Institutional, Descriptive Tone

**Do**:
- Use neutral, factual language
- Describe what is, not what should be
- Maintain professional, academic voice
- Write for Smeal College of Business website audience

**Don't**:
- Use prescriptive language ("students should," "you must")
- Provide recommendations or advice
- Use conversational or casual tone
- Write as if instructing students directly

### 2. Avoid AI Voice Artifacts

**Common AI voice patterns to avoid**:
- Signposting phrases: "more broadly," "it's important to note," "additionally," "furthermore"
- Over-explanation: "In other words," "To put it simply," "Essentially"
- Meta-commentary: "This section will discuss," "As we've seen"
- Repetitive transitions: Starting every paragraph with "However," "Moreover," "Furthermore"

**Detection**: If a sentence sounds like it's explaining structure rather than content, remove it.

### 3. Sentence Rhythm Constraints

**Avoid comma chains**:
- Bad: "AI tools, which are increasingly common in finance, can help with analysis, though they have limitations, and students should understand these limitations."
- Good: "AI tools are increasingly common in finance. They can help with analysis. They also have limitations. Students should understand these limitations."

**Prefer shorter sentences**:
- Break complex ideas into multiple sentences
- One main idea per sentence
- Use periods, not commas, to separate distinct thoughts

**Paragraph structure**:
- 2-4 sentences per paragraph typical
- Each paragraph has one clear purpose
- Avoid paragraphs that try to cover multiple topics

### 4. Section-Specific Patterns

#### Section 1: AI in [Major Name]
**Opening**: Direct statement connecting AI to major's core concerns (pressure-before-technology pattern)
**Deepening**: One paragraph expanding the connection
**Structure**: 2-3 paragraphs maximum
**Tone**: Overview, setting context
**Avoid**: Detailed explanations (save for later sections), closing summaries

#### Section 2: Where AI Appears
**Opening**: Direct statement about contexts where AI appears
**Body**: Each context gets its own paragraph (2-3 sentences each)
**Structure**: Specific contexts, no closing summary
**Tone**: Descriptive, specific, major-anchored
**Avoid**: Vague statements, generic contexts, closing summaries

#### Section 3: What AI Is Expected to Do
**Opening**: Clear statement about AI's role in major contexts
**Body**: Specific capabilities, one per paragraph (2-3 sentences each)
**Structure**: Functional description, no closing summary
**Tone**: Functional, descriptive, major-anchored
**Avoid**: Promises, guarantees, generic capabilities, closing summaries

#### Section 4: Limits and Common Misunderstandings
**Opening**: Acknowledge limitations exist
**Body**: Each limitation gets its own paragraph, rooted in discipline logic (field-native limits)
**Structure**: Field-specific limitations, no closing summary
**Tone**: Candid but neutral, discipline-anchored
**Avoid**: Generic AI limitations, overly negative language, closing summaries

#### Section 5: Key Considerations
**Opening**: Note considerations exist (not "summary")
**Body**: Important points reframed as considerations (not recaps), each in its own paragraph
**Structure**: Reframed considerations with discipline-specific reasons, no closing summary
**Tone**: Informative, not prescriptive, major-anchored
**Avoid**: Summarizing previous sections, direct advice, closing summaries

### 5. Content Constraints

**No tool/platform mentions**:
- Don't name specific AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
- Don't name vendors or platforms
- Refer generically: "AI tools," "AI systems," "AI applications"

**No recommendations**:
- Don't say "students should" or "it's recommended"
- Don't provide "best practices"
- Describe what exists, not what to do

**No unsupported claims**:
- All claims must trace to PackA or PackB
- If not in canon, note limitation or remove claim
- Don't invent statistics or facts

### 6. Paragraph Endings

**Avoid repetitive endings**:
- Don't end every paragraph with "in this major" or "for students"
- Vary sentence structure and paragraph conclusions
- Each paragraph should feel distinct

**Pattern to watch for**:
- Paragraph 1 ends: "...in accounting."
- Paragraph 2 ends: "...in accounting."
- Paragraph 3 ends: "...in accounting."

**Fix**: Vary endings, restructure sentences.

### 7. Transitions Between Sections

**Sections stand completely alone**:
- No cross-references between sections
- No "as we saw" or "building on" language
- Each section starts fresh with its own purpose

**Avoid**:
- "As we saw in the previous section..."
- "Building on what was discussed above..."
- "Now that we've covered X, let's turn to Y..."
- Any reference to other sections

**Prefer**: Each section is independent. No connections or transitions.

### 8. Pressure-Before-Technology Pattern

**Start with field problems, then connect AI**:
- Sections start with the discipline's problems/concerns
- Then connect AI as a response to those problems
- Not: "AI tools exist, here's how [major] uses them"
- But: "[Major] deals with X problems, AI appears in contexts addressing X"

**Pattern**: Field concern → AI context → How AI relates

### 9. Field-Native Limits

**Limitations arise from discipline logic**:
- Not generic AI problems ("AI has hallucinations")
- But field-specific concerns ("In [major] contexts, AI may produce [field-specific problem]")
- Each limitation connects to discipline's specific concerns, information use, and accuracy requirements

### 10. Major-Specific Anchoring

**Every statement connects to major's canon**:
- All content traces to PackB major description
- All AI concepts trace to PackA
- No generic statements that could apply to any major
- Every paragraph includes major-specific context

## Style Checklist (Human Review)

Before approving any section, check:
- [ ] No signposting phrases ("more broadly," "it's important to note")
- [ ] No comma chains (complex sentences broken up)
- [ ] No tool/platform names mentioned
- [ ] No recommendations or advice ("students should")
- [ ] Paragraphs have varied endings
- [ ] Sentences are clear and direct
- [ ] Tone is institutional and descriptive
- [ ] Each paragraph has distinct purpose
- [ ] Section opening is direct, not meta-commentary
- [ ] All claims traceable to PackA/PackB

## Examples

### Bad (AI Voice)
"More broadly, it's important to note that AI tools, which are increasingly common in finance, can help with analysis, though they have limitations, and students should understand these limitations, which we'll discuss further in the next section."

### Good (Human Voice)
"AI tools are increasingly common in finance. They can help with analysis. They also have limitations. Understanding these limitations is important."

### Bad (Prescriptive)
"Students should use AI tools responsibly and check with their instructors before using AI for assignments."

### Good (Descriptive)
"AI tools raise questions about responsible use. Many instructors have policies about AI use in assignments. Students encounter these questions in their coursework."

## Summary

Style rules prioritize:
1. **Institutional tone** over conversational
2. **Descriptive language** over prescriptive
3. **Clear, direct sentences** over complex chains
4. **Varied structure** over repetitive patterns
5. **Human voice** over AI artifacts

These rules ensure content sounds like it was written by a human expert, not generated by AI.

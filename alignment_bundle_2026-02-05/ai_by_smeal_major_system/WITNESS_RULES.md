# Witness Rules: Extracted from Completed Examples

## Source

These rules are extracted from analysis of the three completed major pages:
- Accounting
- Actuarial Science
- Corporate Innovation and Entrepreneurship

**Note**: When `AI by Smeal Major.pdf` is available, ChatGPT should read it directly as the primary style witness. These rules summarize the patterns found in those examples.

## Core Patterns

### 1. Stable Section Structure

All pages follow exactly 5 sections:
1. **AI in [Major Name]** - Brief overview (2-3 paragraphs)
2. **Where AI Appears** - Specific contexts (bulleted or short paragraphs)
3. **What AI Is Expected to Do** - Role and capabilities (functional description)
4. **Limits and Common Misunderstandings** - Discipline-native limitations
5. **Key Considerations** - Important points (not summary, reframed considerations)

Each section stands alone. No cross-references or "as we saw" transitions.

### 2. Paragraph Roles Per Section

#### Section 1: AI in [Major Name]
- **Opening**: Direct statement connecting AI to the major's core concerns
- **Deepening**: One paragraph expanding the connection
- **Closing**: Brief transition to what follows (implicit, not explicit)

#### Section 2: Where AI Appears
- **Opening**: Direct statement about contexts
- **Body**: Each context gets its own paragraph or bullet (2-3 sentences each)
- **No closing summary**: Ends with last context

#### Section 3: What AI Is Expected to Do
- **Opening**: Clear statement about AI's role
- **Body**: Specific capabilities, one per paragraph (2-3 sentences)
- **No closing**: Ends with last capability

#### Section 4: Limits and Common Misunderstandings
- **Opening**: Acknowledge limitations exist
- **Body**: Each limitation gets its own paragraph, rooted in discipline logic
- **No closing**: Ends with last limitation

#### Section 5: Key Considerations
- **Opening**: Note considerations exist (not "summary")
- **Body**: Important points reframed as considerations (not recaps)
- **No closing**: Ends with last consideration

### 3. Discourse Framing Rule

**"How AI is discussed" vs "What AI does"**

- Pages describe **how AI relates to the field**, not **what AI does generically**
- Every statement connects AI to the major's specific concerns
- Avoid generic AI capabilities; always anchor in discipline context
- Example: Not "AI can analyze data" but "AI tools appear in financial analysis contexts where accountants work with numerical information"

### 4. "Pressure-Before-Technology" Pattern

**Field problem space first, technology second**

- Sections start with the discipline's problems/concerns
- Then connect AI as a response to those problems
- Not: "AI tools exist, here's how finance uses them"
- But: "Finance deals with X problems, AI appears in contexts addressing X"

**Example structure**:
- Paragraph 1: Field's core challenge/concern
- Paragraph 2: AI appears in contexts addressing that challenge
- Paragraph 3: How AI relates to that challenge

### 5. Expectation vs Reality Separation

**Section 3 ("What AI Is Expected to Do") vs Section 4 ("Limits")**

- Section 3 describes **what AI is expected to do** (functional role)
- Section 4 describes **what AI cannot do** (limitations)
- These are separate concerns, not opposites
- Section 4 limitations arise from **discipline logic**, not generic AI limitations

### 6. Field-Native Limits

**Limits arise from discipline logic, not generic AI problems**

- Limitations are specific to how the field uses AI
- Not: "AI has hallucinations" (generic)
- But: "In accounting contexts, AI tools may produce inaccurate financial data that appears correct" (field-specific)

**Pattern**: Each limitation connects to:
- The discipline's specific concerns
- How the discipline uses information
- What the discipline requires for accuracy/trust

### 7. "Key Considerations" Reframing Behavior

**Not a summary, but reframed considerations**

- Section 5 does NOT summarize previous sections
- Section 5 reframes important points as **considerations** for the discipline
- Each consideration connects to:
  - Academic integrity (if relevant)
  - Professional expectations (if relevant)
  - Practical applications (if relevant)
  - Field-specific concerns

**Pattern**: "In [major], [consideration] matters because [discipline-specific reason]"

### 8. Sentence Discipline

#### Length
- Short to medium sentences (10-20 words typical)
- Occasional longer sentence for complex idea (25 words max)
- Break complex ideas into multiple sentences

#### No Signposting
- No "more broadly," "it's important to note," "additionally"
- No "in other words," "to put it simply"
- No meta-commentary: "This section will discuss," "As we've seen"

#### No Comma Chains
- Avoid sentences with 3+ clauses connected by commas
- Prefer periods over commas for distinct thoughts
- Example: "AI tools are common in finance. They help with analysis. They have limitations."

#### Varied Paragraph Endings
- Don't end every paragraph with "in [major]" or "for students"
- Vary sentence structure
- Each paragraph should feel distinct

#### No Conclusions
- Sections don't end with summary statements
- Sections don't end with "in conclusion" or "to summarize"
- Last paragraph is just the last point, not a wrap-up

### 9. Major-Specific Anchoring

**Every statement connects to the major's canon**

- All content traces to PackB major description
- All AI concepts trace to PackA
- No generic statements that could apply to any major
- Every paragraph includes major-specific context

**Pattern**: "[Major] focuses on [X]. AI appears in contexts where [X] is addressed."

### 10. Descriptive, Not Instructional

**Describe what is, not what should be**

- No "students should" or "it's recommended"
- No advice or guidance
- No "best practices"
- Describe contexts, capabilities, limitations, considerations
- Let readers draw their own conclusions

## Application Rules

When drafting:
1. Start each section with discipline concerns (pressure-before-technology)
2. Connect AI to those concerns (discourse framing)
3. Keep sentences short, varied, no signposting
4. Make limitations field-native, not generic
5. Reframe considerations, don't summarize
6. Anchor every statement in major-specific canon
7. Describe, don't instruct

## Quality Check

Before approving any section, verify:
- [ ] Section follows stable structure
- [ ] Paragraphs have correct roles (opening/deepening/closing)
- [ ] Discourse frames "how AI relates" not "what AI does"
- [ ] Pressure-before-technology pattern present
- [ ] Limitations are field-native, not generic
- [ ] Key Considerations reframe, don't summarize
- [ ] Sentences short/medium, no comma chains
- [ ] No signposting phrases
- [ ] Paragraph endings varied
- [ ] Every statement anchored in major-specific canon
- [ ] Descriptive, not instructional

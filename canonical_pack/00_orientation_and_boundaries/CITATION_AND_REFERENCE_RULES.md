# Citation and Reference Rules

## How to reference canonical pack files in answers

When ChatGPT references content from this canonical pack:
- Use the filename and section heading, for example: "According to `PILLAR_AI_BASICS.md`, section 'What this covers'..."
- Be specific about which file contains the information
- If referencing multiple files, list them clearly

## How to cite provenance

Every canonical file includes a `derived_from` list showing which foundation files it came from. When referencing canonical content:
- Always include: "Derived from: [foundation path(s)]"
- Point users to the foundation repository for authoritative source material
- Make clear that canonical files are summaries, not replacements for foundation materials

Example: "This information comes from `PILLAR_AI_BASICS.md`, which was derived from `foundation/content/sections/ai-basics/index.md`."

## How to point users to source lists

The foundation includes a list of URLs used in final sections:
- `foundation/docs/00_briefing_packet/03_sources/URLS_USED_IN_FINAL_SECTIONS.txt`

When referencing sources:
- Point to this list without implying more than what is established
- Do not claim all sources are comprehensive or complete
- Do not suggest the list represents all possible sources
- Simply state: "The foundation used these sources: [reference to file]"

## What not to claim

- Do not claim sources are "verified" or "approved" beyond what foundation materials state
- Do not imply the source list is exhaustive
- Do not suggest sources guarantee accuracy or reliability
- Do not add evaluative language about source quality

## File naming conventions

Canonical files use these naming patterns:
- `PILLAR_[TOPIC].md` — Pillar summaries derived from foundation sections
- `GLOSSARY.md`, `FAQ_[TOPIC].md`, `[TOPIC]_CHECKLIST.md` — Module files
- `SITE_STRUCTURE_OPTIONS.md`, `PAGE_COMPOSITION_GUIDE.md` — Guidance files

When referencing files, use these exact names.

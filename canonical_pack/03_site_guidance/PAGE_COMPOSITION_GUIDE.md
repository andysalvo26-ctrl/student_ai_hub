# Page Composition Guide

This guide explains how to build website pages by selecting and organizing content from the canonical pack's pillars and modules.

## Basic Process

1. **Choose a pillar file** that matches your page topic (e.g., `PILLAR_AI_BASICS.md` for an "AI Basics" page)
2. **Select relevant sections** from the pillar (What this covers, Key ideas, Common misunderstandings)
3. **Add supporting content** from modules as needed (glossary terms, FAQ items, checklist items)
4. **Organize for readability** using headings, bullets, and short paragraphs
5. **Do not invent** new content beyond what's in the canonical pack

## Using Pillar Content

Each pillar file (`PILLAR_*.md`) contains:
- **What this covers**: Use as an overview or introduction
- **Key ideas**: Expand into main content sections with explanations
- **Common misunderstandings**: Include as a "Things to Know" or "Important Notes" section
- **How to use this section**: Internal guidance, not for public pages

## Adding Module Content

**Glossary terms**: When a term appears in pillar content, you can:
- Link to a glossary page
- Include a brief inline definition
- Add a "Key Terms" sidebar

**FAQ items**: FAQ content can be:
- A standalone FAQ page
- Integrated into relevant pillar pages as "Common Questions"
- Used to create topic-specific FAQ sections

**Checklist items**: Checklists can be:
- Standalone reference pages
- Integrated into pillar pages as "Things to Consider" sections
- Used to create interactive decision guides (if your platform supports it)

## Example: Building an "AI Basics" Page

**From `PILLAR_AI_BASICS.md`**:
- Use "What this covers" as page introduction
- Expand "Key ideas" into main sections:
  - What is Artificial Intelligence?
  - Machine Learning and Related Terms
  - How Modern AI Systems Work
- Include "Common misunderstandings" as a "Important Limitations" section

**Add from `GLOSSARY.md`**:
- Include definitions for AI, machine learning, deep learning, LLM
- Either inline or link to full glossary

**Optional additions**:
- Link to relevant FAQ items from `FAQ_STUDENTS.md`
- Reference `DECISION_CHECKLIST.md` if appropriate

## Organizing Content

- **Use clear headings** that match pillar structure
- **Keep paragraphs short** (2-3 sentences)
- **Use bullets** for lists of ideas or concepts
- **Add transitions** between sections for flow
- **Include provenance** noting content comes from foundation materials

## Platform Considerations

This guide is platform-neutral. Your specific platform (Wix, SharePoint, etc.) will determine:
- How you implement headings and formatting
- Whether you can create interactive elements
- How you handle links between pages
- Technical implementation details

Focus on content organization, not platform-specific features.

## Don't Invent

**Critical reminder**: Use only content from canonical pack files. Do not:
- Add information not in the foundation
- Invent new facts or claims
- Fill gaps with general knowledge
- Create content that goes beyond foundation materials

If something is missing, note that it's not covered in the foundation materials rather than inventing it.

## Human Review

All pages should be reviewed by humans before publishing. The canonical pack provides content; human judgment determines:
- Final organization and flow
- Which module content to include
- How to present information clearly
- Whether additional context is needed

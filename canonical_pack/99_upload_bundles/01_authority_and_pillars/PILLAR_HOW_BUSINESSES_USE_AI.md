# Pillar: How Businesses Are Using AI

## What this covers

- Common business applications of AI across industries
- Examples from manufacturing, banking, healthcare, and retail
- Organizational and strategic considerations for AI integration
- Limits, tradeoffs, and risks in business use

## Key ideas

- **Common applications**: Data analysis and decision-making, customer experience improvement, content generation, IT operations optimization, sales and marketing, cybersecurity, workflow automation, fraud detection, chatbots, and predictive analytics.
- **Industry examples**: Manufacturing uses AI for predictive maintenance and defect detection. Banking uses AI for fraud detection and customer service. Healthcare uses AI for clinical decision support and patient outcome prediction. Retail uses AI-powered shopping tools.
- **Organizational requirements**: Integrating AI requires understanding technologies like natural language processing and machine learning. Organizations need proper data infrastructure and governance frameworks.
- **Business models**: Companies identify AI-enabled business models they can scale, including supplier companies, omnichannel companies, modular producers, and ecosystem drivers.

## Common misunderstandings

- **Explainability**: Understanding why AI models do what they do is difficult. Systems can be fooled or fail on tasks humans perform easily. Models may only perform to about 95% of human accuracy.
- **Bias in business**: Machines trained by humans can incorporate human biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes. Some models have exacerbated social problems.
- **Maintenance complexity**: AI systems change quickly, and tools that work today may need reworking weeks later. Building and maintaining AI systems is not simple.

## How to use this section

This pillar provides business context for students. Use it when:
- Building a "Business Applications" or "How Companies Use AI" page
- Providing examples of real-world AI use
- Explaining strategic considerations for organizations
- Addressing questions about AI in business settings

Focus on patterns and examples, not prescriptive advice. Describe what organizations are doing, not what they should do.

# FAQ: Business Context

## How are businesses using AI?

Organizations use AI to strengthen data analysis and decision-making, improve customer experiences, generate content, optimize IT operations, sales, marketing, and cybersecurity. AI supports human workforces in optimizing workflows and making operations more efficient through automation, data processing, and predictive analytics.

## What are some real-world examples?

Manufacturing companies use AI for predictive maintenance and defect detection. Banks use AI for fraud detection and customer service. Healthcare organizations use AI for clinical decision support and patient outcome prediction. Retailers use AI-powered shopping tools to help customers make purchasing decisions.

## What do organizations need to integrate AI?

Organizations typically need an understanding of technologies like natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning. They need proper data infrastructure and governance frameworks to manage data and support AI technology. Having a strong data governance framework helps keep data available and secure.

## What are the risks businesses face with AI?

Concerns include explainability (understanding why models do what they do), bias (systems can perpetuate discrimination), and maintenance complexity (tools that work today may need reworking weeks later). Systems can be fooled or fail on tasks humans perform easily. Some models may only perform to about 95% of human accuracy.

## How do businesses address bias in AI?

Machines trained by humans can incorporate human biases. If biased information or data reflecting existing inequities is fed to a machine learning program, the program will learn to replicate it. Some organizations spread risk across vendors rather than relying on a single provider.

## What about AI decision-making in business?

AI systems make many sorts of decisions that significantly impact people's lives, such as who gets a loan, who is admitted to a university, who gets an advertised job, and who is likely to reoffend. Many of these decisions are not readily explainable, which is called the opacity or black box problem.

## Are there standards for AI in business?

Federal agencies have engaged in developing standards for artificial intelligence. Executive orders have directed agencies to ensure technical standards minimize vulnerability to attacks and reflect federal priorities. UNESCO has developed global standards for AI ethics. Some institutions have created guidelines, though policies are not always clear or comprehensive.

## What business models incorporate AI?

Researchers have identified different business model categories: supplier companies that sell products through third parties, omnichannel companies with digital and physical presence, modular producers offering plug-and-play products, and ecosystem drivers offering go-to destinations in customer domains.

## How quickly do AI systems change?

The underlying models change quickly, and tools that work today may need reworking weeks later. This reality shapes how organizations think about vendors. Some retailers are spreading risk across vendors rather than relying on a single provider.

## What should organizations consider before implementing AI?

Organizations should consider whether they have the necessary resources to create and effectively use AI tools. More complex AI applications can be useful for the right organization, but they require proper infrastructure. Otherwise, the project could end up being a net negative.

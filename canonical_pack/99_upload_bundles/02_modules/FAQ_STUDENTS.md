# FAQ for Students

## Can I use AI for my coursework?

It depends on your instructor's expectations. Some instructors allow AI use for certain tasks like idea generation, editing, or clarification. Others may prohibit it. Check your syllabus and ask your instructor if you're unsure. If AI use is allowed, document how you used it.

## Do I need to cite AI-generated content?

Yes. Proper citation of AI-generated content is important for maintaining transparency and integrity. Check your syllabus to confirm your instructor's expectations for AI citations. When in doubt, ask questions and document your AI use.

## What are appropriate uses of AI for schoolwork?

Appropriate uses include idea generation (brainstorming topics, thesis statements, outlines), clarification of difficult concepts, editing and proofreading, coding assistance for learning, information searching, summarizing documents, and creating first drafts. The key question is whether AI use facilitates or takes away opportunities for deeper learning.

## What should I be careful about when using AI tools?

AI tools can produce incorrect information (hallucinations), exhibit bias, and misattribute sources. Not everything AI generates is accurate or useful. You should verify information independently and think critically about AI output. Don't rely solely on AI-generated content for critical academic work.

## Can I use AI tools with confidential information?

Many publicly available AI tools should not be used with confidential or sensitive information. Institutionally licensed tools may have different privacy protections. Check your institution's guidelines about what types of data can be entered into different AI tools.

## What about AI meeting assistants?

AI meeting assistants can pose privacy, regulatory, and legal risks. Some institutions recommend avoiding third-party bots in virtual meetings, as they can scrape calendar information and save meetings in unknown places. Check your institution's guidelines regarding AI tools in meetings.

## How do I know if AI is helping or hurting my learning?

The relationship depends on how you use the technology. If AI facilitates thinking deeply about material—comparing concepts, explaining in your own words, self-quizzing—it may help. If it takes away opportunities to engage directly with material, it may hurt. What's important is using effective learning strategies, not delegating your learning process to an AI tool.

## What if I'm not sure whether AI use is allowed?

Ask your instructor. When in doubt, ask questions and document your AI use. Understanding what your instructor expects is typically recommended before using AI for assignments.

## Are AI tools reliable?

AI tools have documented limitations. They can produce incorrect information, exhibit bias, and make up sources. You should verify claims and sources independently. AI tools are not infallible and may produce errors or incomplete information.

## What about academic integrity?

Academic integrity involves using AI tools appropriately and transparently. Some institutions treat any use of generative AI as analogous to receiving help from another person. Using AI to substantially complete an assignment may be prohibited. Always check with your instructor about expectations.

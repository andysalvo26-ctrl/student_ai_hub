# AI Tools You Might Use

## Common Categories of AI Tools

AI tools for general use include chatbots and AI assistants designed to understand and generate human-like responses to text-based, natural language prompts. These tools can generate text, code, and images, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, or integrate with productivity and collaboration tools. Some tools combine advanced language understanding and generation capabilities to assist users in various tasks, such as writing, researching, and creating content.

AI tools for research can help discover new sources for literature reviews or research assignments. These tools synthesize information from large databases of scholarly output with the aim of finding the most relevant articles and saving researchers' time. Some research tools focus on the relationships between research papers to find similar research, while others help researchers find and synthesize answers to research questions by focusing on scholarly authors' findings and claims in each paper. Some tools summarize key points and claims of articles into summary formats that researchers can read and annotate when compiling research on a given topic.

AI meeting assistants can transcribe and summarize online meetings. These tools have legitimate uses, such as for accessibility and capturing notes for later reference. Some institutions have vetted and approved certain AI features for use in meetings, including those that discuss sensitive or confidential information. However, these tools can also pose substantial privacy, regulatory, and legal risks, and have the potential to stifle conversation and open inquiry.

AI developer tools include AI assistants and API access to enable developers to integrate large language models into their own applications, products, or services. This includes chatbot creation and customization, building and testing applications, access to model training and deployment, coding, predictive analytics, and more. Code and low-code or no-code offerings are available. (Source: www_huit_harvard_edu__8f8b35cba5ce9e90::c0002)

## Typical Use Cases for Students

Students may encounter AI tools that can assist with writing tasks, such as generating different content formats, editing text, and improving clarity. Some tools can help with brainstorming and initial idea development for research projects. These tools can be used in the developmental stages of research for brainstorming and data analysis. Some tools allow users to upload documents, web URLs, and videos into a workspace, then ask questions and receive answers with citations pointing back to the original text.

AI tools can help students with research tasks by quickly summarizing documents, generating different content formats such as briefing documents and study guides, and providing overviews of research topics. Some tools aim to streamline research, enhance productivity, and improve information retention by providing AI-driven insights grounded in uploaded documents. As generative AI becomes more integrated in online search tools, even the very early stages of research and topic development could incorporate AI.

Some students use AI tools to help explain concepts, generate questions, and expand upon topics they are studying. These tools can function as study aids that provide explanations and help students explore different aspects of course material. However, according to some institutional guidance, students should be aware that AI tools have limitations and may not always provide accurate information.

## Strengths and Limitations of Tools

AI tools can help synthesize information from large databases and save researchers' time by finding relevant articles and summarizing key points. Some tools can generate different content formats, translate languages, and assist with various writing and research tasks. Tools that are integrated with productivity platforms can provide seamless access to AI capabilities within existing workflows. Some tools are designed to provide answers with citations pointing back to original sources, which can help users verify information. (Source: guides_library_georgetown_edu__3fee8ba3bf16d12d::c0000, aiguidebook_vcu_edu__c78139a06334a4fe::c0000, www_huit_harvard_edu__8f8b35cba5ce9e90::c0001)

The resources available represent an incomplete list of tools, and the landscape of AI tools changes frequently. As with research databases or any other search tool, it's important not to rely on one tool for all research needs, as users risk missing important information on their topic of interest. Some tools may provide information that needs to be verified, and users should always look up claims and sources to verify their credibility.

## Things to Be Careful About

When using AI tools, students should be aware of data privacy and security considerations. Some institutions have guidelines about what types of data can be entered into publicly available AI tools compared to tools that are licensed by institutions. Many publicly available AI tools should not be used with confidential or sensitive information. Tools that are licensed by institutions may have different data classification levels and privacy protections compared to publicly available versions.

AI meeting assistants can pose substantial privacy, regulatory, and legal risks, and have the potential to stifle conversation and open inquiry. Some institutions recommend avoiding use of third-party bots in virtual meetings, as they can scrape calendar information and keep written accounts or recorded minutes of meetings. These bots may save meetings in unknown places and join meetings when users are not present. Some institutions have guidelines regarding the use of AI tools in meetings and collaborative settings that students are expected to follow. (Source: www_huit_harvard_edu__8f8b35cba5ce9e90::c0000, aiguidebook_vcu_edu__c78139a06334a4fe::c0002)

Students may need to verify information provided by AI tools and avoid relying solely on AI-generated content for critical academic work. Some tools may provide inaccurate information or make claims that need to be verified through other sources. It's important to remember that AI tools are not infallible and may produce errors or incomplete information. Students are often advised to verify claims and sources independently.

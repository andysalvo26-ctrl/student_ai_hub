  "full_text": "Overview:\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the landscape of higher education, impacting how students learn, how faculty teach, and how institutions operate. This report summarizes the findings of recent surveys that explored AI usage, AI competencies, and attitudes toward AI among students and faculty in higher education settings. The surveys included in this report were conducted in 2024 and 2025, providing a snapshot of the current state of AI in higher education and offering insights into its potential future. This summary was created with the help of Google Gemini Advanced Pro 1.5 which greatly aided in finding the survey data and in compiling the final results for this report.\nAI Usage Among Students\nSeveral surveys conducted in 2024 and 2025 revealed that a significant majority of students are using AI in their studies. A global survey by the Digital Education Council found that 86% of students use AI in their studies, with 54% using it weekly and nearly one in four using it daily 1. This high rate of adoption is mirrored in other surveys, such as the Chegg survey of 11,706 undergraduate students across 15 countries, which found that 80% of students worldwide have used generative AI to support their university studies 2. Similarly, a survey of 1,041 full-time undergraduate students in the UK by HEPI and Kortext found that 92% of students were using AI tools in their studies, up from 66% the previous year 3. This rapid increase in student AI adoption in a short period highlights the growing importance of AI in the student learning experience.\nStudents are using a variety of AI tools to support their studies, with ChatGPT emerging as the most popular, followed by Grammarly and Microsoft Copilot 1. These tools are being used for a wide range of tasks, including:\n- Searching for information: Students are using AI to quickly and efficiently find relevant information for their coursework, research projects, and general knowledge inquiries 1.\n- Checking grammar and improving writing: AI-powered writing assistants like Grammarly are helping students improve the clarity, conciseness, and accuracy of their writing 1.\n- Summarizing and paraphrasing documents: AI tools are being used to condense lengthy articles and research papers into concise summaries, and to rephrase text while maintaining its original meaning 1.\n- Creating first drafts: Students are leveraging AI to generate initial drafts of essays, reports, and other written assignments, providing a starting point for their own writing and editing process 1.\n- Explaining complex concepts: AI tutors and chatbots are helping students understand difficult concepts by providing clear explanations, examples, and step-by-step guidance 4.\n- Suggesting research ideas: AI tools are being used to generate research topics, identify relevant sources, and explore different perspectives on a given subject 4.\nDespite the widespread use of AI and the potential benefits it offers, many students express concerns about its accuracy, reliability, and ethical implications. In the Chegg survey, 53% of students who had used AI to support their studies expressed concern about receiving incorrect or inaccurate information 2. This concern is particularly relevant in educational contexts where accuracy and trustworthiness of information are paramount. Students also voiced concerns about data privacy and the potential for AI to undermine critical thinking skills 5. If students become overly reliant on AI to provide answers and complete tasks, they may not develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills necessary for academic success and future careers.\nFurthermore, a survey conducted at the Tecnologico de Monterrey in Guadalajara found that 55% of students believe that AI could negatively impact academic integrity 6. This concern stems from the potential for students to misuse AI tools to cheat on assignments or exams, such as by generating essays or answers automatically without demonstrating their own understanding or effort.\nAI Usage Among Faculty\nSurveys of faculty in higher education suggest that AI adoption among educators is increasing, but still lags behind student use. A survey by Ellucian found that 93% of higher education staff expect to expand their use of AI for work purposes over the next two years 7. However, the Digital Education Council’s 2025 Global AI Faculty Survey found that while 61% of faculty have used AI in teaching, 88% do so minimally 8. This suggests that many faculty may be hesitant to fully integrate AI into their teaching practices or may be less aware of the potential benefits and applications of AI in education.\nA survey by the American Association of Colleges & Universities (AAC&U) and Elon University found that most higher education leaders say that smaller numbers of faculty use AI as part of their jobs, with 62% estimating that fewer than half of faculty use the tools 9. This disparity between faculty and student AI usage raises questions about how institutions can effectively support faculty in adopting and integrating AI in ways that enhance teaching and learning.\nFaculty are exploring various ways to use AI in their work, including:\n- Supporting curriculum design: AI can assist faculty in designing more effective and engaging curricula by analyzing student data, identifying learning gaps, and suggesting relevant resources 10.\n- Automating administrative workflows: AI can automate repetitive administrative tasks, such as grading, scheduling, and communication, freeing up faculty time for more meaningful activities like teaching and research 10.\n- Enhancing teaching practices: AI can be used to create personalized learning experiences, provide targeted feedback, and adapt instruction to individual student needs 11.\n- Personalizing learning: AI-powered learning platforms can tailor content, pacing, and activities to each student’s learning style and preferences, creating a more individualized and effective learning experience 11.\nSimilar to students, faculty also express concerns about the accuracy, ethical implications, and potential downsides of AI in education. In the Ellucian survey, 49% of respondents were worried about bias in AI models, and 59% reported concerns about data security and privacy 12. Faculty also voiced concerns about the potential for AI to undermine academic integrity and critical thinking skills 12. A survey of faculty at Northeastern University found that the most common concerns about AI included the potential for cheating, over-reliance on AI, and ethical concerns 13. These concerns highlight the need for institutions to provide clear guidelines and support for faculty in using AI responsibly and ethically.\nAI Competencies Among Students and Faculty\nWhile both students and faculty are increasingly using AI, surveys suggest that many feel unprepared for an AI-driven world. In the Digital Education Council’s student survey, 58% of students reported that they do not feel they have sufficient AI knowledge and skills, and 48% do not feel adequately prepared for an AI-enabled workplace 14. This lack of AI competency is not limited to students. In the AAC&U and Elon University survey, 59% of higher education leaders believed that last spring’s graduates were not prepared for work in companies where skill in using AI tools is important 9.\nThe Digital Education Council’s faculty survey found that 40% of faculty feel that they are just beginning their AI literacy journey, and only 17% are at an advanced or expert level 15. This disconnect between high AI usage and low AI competency among both students and faculty underscores the urgent need for AI literacy initiatives in higher education. Institutions need to invest in training and resources to help students and educators develop the competencies needed to thrive in an AI-driven world.\nFurthermore, it is important to consider the equity implications of AI preparedness. A survey by Inside Higher Ed found that first-generation students were less likely to be confident in appropriate use cases for AI compared to their continuing-generation peers 5. This finding suggests that AI has the potential to exacerbate existing inequalities in education, particularly for students from underrepresented backgrounds who may have less access to AI tools and resources or less support in developing AI literacy.\nAttitudes Toward AI in Higher Education\nSurveys reveal a mixed bag of attitudes toward AI in higher education, with both optimism and concern about its potential impact. Many students and faculty express optimism about the potential for AI to enhance learning and teaching 11. AI is seen as a tool that can personalize learning, provide individualized support, and improve efficiency in both teaching and administrative tasks.\nHowever, there are also concerns about the potential negative impacts of AI, such as increased cheating, over-reliance on AI tools, and the widening of digital inequities 16. A survey of faculty at Metropolitan State University of Denver found that 42% of respondents believed that AI tools could have significant time-saving and efficiency-increasing benefits when used ethically and appropriately 17. However, 29% of respondents were concerned about AI’s impact on academic integrity and a decrease in critical thinking skills 17.\nInterestingly, there are regional differences in attitudes toward AI in higher education. A survey by the Digital Education Council found that faculty in the US and Canada have a more negative view of AI compared to other regions 18. While 65% of faculty worldwide saw AI as an opportunity, only 57% of faculty in the US and Canada shared this view. This difference in perspective may be attributed to various factors, such as cultural differences, concerns about job security, or varying levels of exposure to and understanding of AI technologies.\nThese findings suggest that institutions need to proactively address the concerns and challenges associated with AI while also promoting its potential benefits. This includes developing clear policies and guidelines for AI use, providing training and support for students and faculty, and fostering a culture of responsible AI adoption.\nComparing Student and Faculty Survey Findings\nWhile many of the surveys focused on either students or faculty, some key comparisons can be drawn:\n| Category | Student Findings | Faculty Findings |\n| AI Usage | Higher rates of AI use, particularly for coursework and assessments | Lower rates of AI use, with many faculty using AI minimally |\n| AI Competencies | Express a need for more training and support in developing AI literacy and skills | Express a need for more training and support in developing AI literacy and skills |\n| Attitudes Toward AI | A mix of optimism and concern about AI in higher education | A mix of optimism and concern about AI in higher education, with some regional variations |\nThese comparisons highlight some important trends in AI adoption in higher education. Students appear to be more readily embracing AI tools, while faculty are more cautious in their adoption and integration of AI. Both students and faculty recognize the need for greater AI literacy and skills development, suggesting a shared responsibility for institutions to provide adequate support and training.\nPotential Implications for the Future of AI in Higher Education\nThe findings of these surveys have several potential implications for the future of AI in higher education:\n- Increased integration of AI in teaching and learning: As AI tools become more sophisticated and accessible, we can expect to see even greater integration of AI in teaching and learning practices. This may include the use of AI-powered tutors, personalized learning platforms, and automated assessment tools. AI has the potential to democratize education by providing personalized support and expanding access to learning resources 5. However, institutions will need to carefully consider how to integrate AI in ways that enhance, rather than replace, human interaction and critical thinking.\n- Emphasis on AI ethics and responsible use: Institutions will need to place a greater emphasis on AI ethics and responsible use. This includes developing clear policies and guidelines for AI use, providing training on AI bias and fairness, and promoting critical thinking skills in evaluating AI-generated content. It is crucial to ensure that AI is used in a way that aligns with the values and mission of higher education, and that it does not perpetuate or exacerbate existing inequalities.\n- Evolving role of educators: The role of educators will likely evolve in response to the rise of AI. Educators may need to adapt their teaching methods to incorporate AI tools and to focus on developing students’ higher-order thinking skills, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. As AI takes on more routine tasks, educators can focus on fostering deeper learning, mentorship, and personalized guidance for students.\n- Addressing digital equity: Institutions will need to address the digital divide and ensure that all students have equitable access to AI tools and resources. This may include providing technology support, offering affordable AI training programs, and promoting inclusive AI practices. It is essential to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared by all students, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.\nConclusion\nAI has already had a profound impact on higher education, transforming how students learn, how faculty teach, and how institutions operate. The findings of these recent surveys provide valuable insights into the current state of AI adoption, competencies, and attitudes among students and faculty at various higher education institutions. These trends highlight the associated challenges institutions are facing as they adopt AI platforms while trying to balance the benefits and challenges of AI tool use in learning and teaching.\nAppendix: Matrix Summary of Key Survey Findings\n| Survey | Focus | Key Findings | Methodology |\n| Digital Education Council Global AI Student Survey 2024 1 | AI usage among students | 86% of students use AI in their studies; ChatGPT is the most popular tool; students express concerns about AI literacy and university integration of AI | 3,839 responses from bachelor, masters, and doctorate students across 16 countries |\n| Chegg Global Student Survey 2025 2 | AI usage among students | 80% of students worldwide have used generative AI; accuracy is a top concern; students want AI tools designed for education | 11,706 undergraduate students aged 18-21 years across 15 countries |\n| HEPI/Kortext Student Generative AI Survey 2025 3 | AI usage among students | 92% of students use AI tools; AI use has increased significantly since 2024; students use AI to save time and improve work quality | 1,041 online interviews with full-time undergraduate students in the UK |\n| Ellucian AI in Higher Education Survey 2024 12 | AI usage among faculty and administrators | 93% of higher ed staff expect to expand AI use; concerns about bias, data privacy, and impact on critical thinking | 445 faculty and administrators from more than 330 institutions across the U.S. and Canada |\n| AAC&U/Elon University Survey of Higher Education Leaders 2024 9 | AI usage and attitudes among higher education leaders | 89% of leaders say students use AI; 59% report increased cheating; 91% believe AI will enhance learning | 337 college leaders responded to at least some portion of the survey |\n| Digital Education Council Global AI Faculty Survey 2025 15 | AI usage and attitudes among faculty | 61% of faculty have used AI in teaching; 88% do so minimally; concerns about student critical evaluation of AI outputs | 1,681 faculty members at 52 higher education institutions from 28 countries |\n| Metropolitan State University of Denver Faculty Survey 2024 17 | Faculty perceptions of AI | 78% of faculty unfamiliar with AI; 42% believe AI can have time-saving benefits; concerns about academic integrity and critical thinking | Survey responses were collected from faculty members at Metropolitan State University of Denver |\nWorks cited\n1.

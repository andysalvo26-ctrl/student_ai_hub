Your School’s local IT department may also offer additional tools.\nMany other AI tools are available to the public, including tools that are free to use.

They are designed to understand and generate human-like responses to text-based, natural language prompts. They can generate text, code, and images, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, or integrate with productivity and collaboration tools.\nAI meeting assistants (aka “AI note takers” or “bots”) can transcribe and summarize online meetings. Although these tools have legitimate uses (e.g., for accessibility and capturing notes for later reference), they can also pose substantial privacy, regulatory, and legal risks, and have the potential to stifle conversation and open inquiry. AI meeting assistants should not be used in Harvard meetings, with the exception of approved tools with contractual protections.

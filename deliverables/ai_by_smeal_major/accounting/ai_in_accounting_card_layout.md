## CARD 1 — The Accounting Baseline

Accounting centers on accuracy, consistency, and reliability in financial information. The work depends on organized records, traceable decisions, and clear documentation that support managers, investors, regulators, and other stakeholders.

In this context, AI is discussed as a support layer for reviewing and organizing large amounts of financial data, not as a replacement for professional judgment.

## CARD 2 — Where AI Appears in Coursework

Students most often encounter AI in classes tied to auditing, financial reporting, taxation, and internal controls. These are the areas where consistency and error detection are central themes.

AI is introduced as a way to help review large volumes of data and identify patterns that deserve closer attention.

---

## CARD 3 — Where AI Appears in Practice

In professional settings, AI is often mentioned alongside transaction review, risk assessment, and compliance monitoring. Firms describe AI as part of broader efforts to manage growing data volumes while maintaining oversight.

The emphasis is on scale and consistency, especially when review work would otherwise be too time‑intensive to complete manually.

## CARD 4 — Scale, Not Substitution

AI tends to enter the conversation when accounting work scales beyond what can be reviewed by hand. It is typically discussed as a supporting technology that operates within existing processes rather than replacing professional judgment.

The core question is how AI can help reviewers focus their attention without changing the accountability of the decision.

---

## CARD 5 — Review Points That Matter

Accounting majors often hear AI discussed in relation to audit planning, reconciling accounts, or understanding how controls are tested over time. These are the moments where reviewers decide where to look more closely.

AI is framed as a tool that can help prioritize review when time and resources are limited.

---

## CARD 6 — The Classroom vs. Practice Gap

In class, accounting problems are often small and contained. In practice, firms manage continuous streams of transactions across many accounts and entities.

AI is discussed as part of how firms manage that difference while still meeting documentation and reporting expectations.

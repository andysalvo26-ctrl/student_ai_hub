# AI Basics

## What this covers

- Definitions of artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and large language models
- How modern AI systems work at a high level
- Common misconceptions and limitations of AI systems
- The relationship between AI, machine learning, and related terms

## Key ideas

- **AI definition**: Technology that performs tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as recognizing patterns, making decisions, and communicating. AI systems create models of the world based on limited information and make predictions.
- **Machine learning**: A subset of AI that uses algorithms to learn from data, identify patterns, and improve through experience.
- **Deep learning**: An advanced method of machine learning using multilayered neural networks that simulate complex decision-making.
- **Large language models (LLMs)**: Machine learning models designed for natural language processing, trained on vast amounts of text to map probabilities underlying human language.
- **How AI works**: Starts with data, which is prepared as training data. More data generally leads to better performance. Models train themselves to find patterns or make predictions, and programmers can adjust parameters over time.
- **Generative AI**: Creates original content using predictive algorithms, rather than just reacting to input. LLMs predict the next word but don't understand in the way humans do.

## Common misunderstandings

- **Hallucinations**: AI systems can produce inaccurate or fabricated information, sometimes citing sources that don't exist. Information is presented with confidence even when incorrect.
- **Bias**: AI systems can perpetuate bias and discrimination because they're trained on data that includes problematic content. Human biases can be incorporated into algorithms, leading to discriminatory outcomes.
- **Black box problem**: AI systems often have many hidden layers of calculations, making it difficult to understand how they reach their predictions.

## How to use this section

This pillar provides foundational definitions and concepts. Use it when:
- Building an "AI Basics" or "What is AI?" page
- Explaining core terminology to students
- Providing context for other sections
- Addressing common questions about how AI works

Keep explanations simple and avoid technical jargon. Focus on what students need to understand, not implementation details.

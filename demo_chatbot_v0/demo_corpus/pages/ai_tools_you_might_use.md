# AI Tools You Might Use

## What this covers

- Common categories of AI tools students may encounter
- Typical use cases for students
- Strengths and limitations of tools
- Things to be careful about when using tools

## Key ideas

- **Tool categories**: General-use chatbots and AI assistants, research tools that synthesize scholarly information, meeting assistants for transcription and summarization, and developer tools for building applications.
- **Student use cases**: Writing assistance, brainstorming, research tasks, document summarization, concept explanation, and study aids.
- **Strengths**: Can synthesize information from large databases, save time finding relevant articles, generate different content formats, translate languages, and provide citations pointing back to sources.
- **Limitations**: The landscape changes frequently. Tools may provide information that needs verification. Users risk missing important information if relying on one tool. Tools are not infallible and may produce errors.

## Common misunderstandings

- **Data privacy**: Publicly available AI tools should not be used with confidential or sensitive information. Institutionally licensed tools may have different privacy protections.
- **Meeting assistants**: Can pose privacy, regulatory, and legal risks. May scrape calendar information and save meetings in unknown places. Some institutions recommend avoiding third-party bots in virtual meetings.
- **Reliability**: Students may need to verify information provided by AI tools and avoid relying solely on AI-generated content for critical academic work.

## How to use this section

This pillar helps students understand available tools. Use it when:
- Building a "Tools" or "What Tools Are Available" page
- Explaining categories of tools without endorsing specific products
- Providing guidance on tool selection and use
- Addressing privacy and security considerations

Describe categories and patterns, not specific tool recommendations. Avoid "best" or "recommended" language.

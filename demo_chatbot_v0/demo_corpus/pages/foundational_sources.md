# Foundational Sources

The Student AI Hub reference materials are built from a curated set of approved sources. These sources were selected for credibility, relevance, and appropriateness for students.

## Source selection

Sources used in the hub were reviewed and approved before being included. Each source was classified by topic and source type to ensure appropriate use.

## Source registry

The hub maintains a registry of sources that were used to build the reference sections. This registry documents which sources were selected, which were successfully processed, and which were actually used in the published materials.

## Source lifecycle

Sources go through several stages:
- **Collected**: Sources selected and approved for use
- **Ingested**: Sources successfully processed and added to the corpus
- **Used**: Sources whose content was referenced in published reference sections

Not all collected sources are used in final sections. This is documented in the source registry.

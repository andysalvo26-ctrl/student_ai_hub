Understanding ethical considerations is important. Academic integrity involves using AI appropriately and transparently. Accessibility considerations matter when using AI tools.\n\n\n- **Bias**: Many believe smart technologies would end human bias due to machine neutrality. However, machines may maintain and substantiate human bias toward women, different ethnicities, the elderly, people with medical impairments, or other groups.",

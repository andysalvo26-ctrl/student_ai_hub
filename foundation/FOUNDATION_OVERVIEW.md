# Student AI Hub — Foundation Overview

## What this is

This repository documents how the foundation of the Student AI Hub was built. The Student AI Hub is a collection of reference materials about artificial intelligence designed for students. This repository contains the tools, documentation, and reference sections that were created during the initial build phase.

## Why this exists

Before the Student AI Hub could expand, it needed a clear starting point. This foundation establishes that starting point by documenting how the first reference materials were selected, organized, and created. Having this documented process provides a record of how the hub began and what sources were used to build its initial reference sections.

## What was built here

- A defined structure for organizing AI topics into clear sections
- A selected set of approved sources, each reviewed and classified by topic
- A small set of reference materials covering core AI concepts for students
- Documentation of how this foundation was created, from source selection through final review

## How this fits into the Student AI Hub

This foundation establishes the starting point for the Student AI Hub. Future hub content may build on top of this foundation or reference these materials. Not all future content in the Student AI Hub must follow the exact process documented here. The foundation represents one way the hub began, not a requirement for everything that comes after.

## What this is not

- Not the full Student AI Hub
- Not a chatbot or interactive system
- Not a live or ongoing update process
- Not a replacement for coursework or instructor guidance

Put in context, artificial intelligence refers to the general ability of computers to emulate human thought and perform tasks in real-world environments, while machine learning refers to the technologies and algorithms that enable systems to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve themselves through experience and data. Computer programmers and software developers enable computers to analyze data and solve problems — essentially, they create artificial intelligence systems — by applying tools such as: - machine learning - deep learning - neural networks - computer vision - natural language processing Below is a breakdown of the differences between artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as how they are being applied in organizations large and small today. What Is Artificial Intelligence? Artificial Intelligence is the field of developing computers and robots that are capable of behaving in ways that both mimic and go beyond human capabilities.

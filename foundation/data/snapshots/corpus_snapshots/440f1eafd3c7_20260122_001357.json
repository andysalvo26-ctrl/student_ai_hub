  "full_text": "The thoughtful and appropriate use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) can enrich your learning experience at Oregon State. OSU is committed to preparing you for a future where artificial intelligence use is commonplace. Because of this, your faculty are at the forefront of the AI conversation, exploring ways to integrate Artificial Intelligence into the university’s curriculum. Though advanced, artificial intelligence has limitations, including hallucinations and bias. It is important to understand those shortcomings and the continued value of human creation.\nThe misuse of artificial intelligence on an assignment could violate the university's Academic Misconduct Policy. Relevant provisions that AI misuse could violate include:\n- Plagiarism: directly copying AI-generated material without a citation or reference is considered plagiarism\n- Cheating: using AI to complete an assignment without prior authorization from your instructor\n- Fabrication: using AI to create counterfeit citations, interview responses, or research results\nAt OSU, individual faculty have the freedom to set course-specific expectations for artificial intelligence use. It is important to recognize that different classes may have widely varying or even contradictory expectations. You must follow the specific expectations for each course. Always begin the term by carefully reading your syllabus to understand your instructor's expectations regarding AI usage. In order to use generative AI on an assignment, you must be able to answer “yes” to two questions:\n1. Has your instructor provided expectations on how AI can be used on this assignment?\n2. Do you understand what your instructor’s expectations are?\nPotential uses of AI within course settings could include the following:\n- Idea generation: Brainstorming research topics, thesis statements, or outlines.\n- Clarification: Explaining difficult concepts or assignment prompts.\n- Editing and proofreading: Checking grammar, tone, and clarity in writing.\n- Coding assistance: Debugging, explaining algorithms, or generating sample code for learning.\n- Formatting help: Creating citations, tables, or properly formatted documents.\n- Practice and feedback: Simulating exam questions or providing feedback on drafts.\n- Summarization: Condensing readings or lecture notes to highlight key points.\n- Translation or accessibility: Translating text or converting it into plain language or alternate formats.\nYou should always seek clarification on what type of use is permitted and what is prohibited.

When incorporating AI-generated content, such as text or art, into academic work, proper citation not only gives credit to the underlying algorithms and data sources but also acknowledges the human input in training and fine-tuning these models. Additionally, citing AI sources helps maintain transparency and integrity in academic discourse, allowing readers to trace the origins and authenticity of the information presented.\nHowever, the nuances of citing generative AI lie in the evolving landscape of AI capabilities and the ethical complexities involved.

Be it on genetic research, climate change, or scientific research, UNESCO has delivered global standards to maximize the benefits of the scientific discoveries, while minimizing the downside risks, ensuring they contribute to a more inclusive, sustainable, and peaceful world. It has also identified frontier challenges in areas such as the ethics of neurotechnology, on climate engineering, and the internet of things. The rapid rise in artificial intelligence (AI) has created many opportunities globally, from facilitating healthcare diagnoses to enabling human connections through social media and creating labour efficiencies through automated tasks.

Such risks associated with AI have already begun to compound on top of existing inequalities, resulting in further harm to already marginalised groups. Four core values A dynamic understanding of AI The Recommendation interprets AI broadly as systems with the ability to process data in a way which resembles intelligent behaviour. This is crucial as the rapid pace of technological change would quickly render any fixed, narrow definition outdated, and make future-proof policies infeasible. A human rights approach to AI Actionable policies Key policy areas make clear arenas where Member States can make strides towards responsible developments in AI While values and principles are crucial to establishing a basis for any ethical AI framework, recent movements in AI ethics have emphasised the need to move beyond high-level principles and toward practical strategies. The Recommendation does just this by setting out eleven key areas for policy actions. Implementing the Recommendation Women4Ethical AI expert platform to advance gender equality UNESCO's Women4Ethical AI is a new collaborative platform to support governments and companies’ efforts to ensure that women are represented equally in both the design and deployment of AI. The platform’s members will also contribute to the advancement of all the ethical provisions in the Recommendation on the Ethics of AI.

A future goal for all of us should be maintaining focus on emotional intelligence while embracing the healthy uses of AI.”\nMaintaining Academic Integrity Using AI\nStudents must maintain academic integrity when using an AI tool for college assignments - using artificial intelligence tools like chatbots to generate ideas or as a learning tool, not to complete assignments.\nChatGPT, launched in fall 2021 by an artificial intelligence research group, creates detailed responses to questions and prompts, according to CNN Business. The chatbot has been used to draft research papers, violating academic integrity policies.\nAcademic integrity violations include cheating, collusion or complicity, falsification or fabrication, misrepresentation and plagiarism.\n“As a student, if you're using a chatbot to write your paper, you may be accused of cheating, plagiarism and lack of academic integrity. The consequences of this can be severe and include expulsion, loss of transcripts and the forfeiture of tuition and fees,” Billington said.\n“Not only that, students are cheating themselves out of the opportunity to learn and grow. Assignments are meant to help students understand a topic, learn how to learn and think for themselves. These are essential skills for any student to master if they want to advance in their career.”\nHenrichs said students should be aware that AI tools can utilize an algorithm similar to search engines, which can increase bias or focus on a topic.\n“It has been recognized that AI apps or software can demonstrate bias. Students need to be sure to screen, read and recognize items generated that are showing implicit bias,” Henrichs said. “There also appears to be limitations to historical context with AI, which means it’s not capable of making proper correlations or even timelines.”\nUsing Artificial Intelligence as a Learning Tool\nArtificial intelligence can be an innovative learning tool, helping students improve their writing or study more effectively.\n“By creating personalized study guides, students can learn the material more efficiently and effectively,” Billington said. “They can also dig deeper into the areas of their own interest.”\nCollege students can use artificial intelligence to:\n-\nGenerate ideas or creativity.\n-\nExplore how to frame ideas when struggling with outlining information.\n-\nCreate a formative assessment.\n-\nGenerate practice questions from the topic.\n-\nPractice speech skills for a persuasive argument.\n-\nCreate study plans.\n-\nAssist with note-taking strategies.\n-\nPractice providing feedback or education to others that is appropriate and leveled to the intended audience.\nA Step-by-Step Guide to Using a Chatbot in College\nWhen using a chatbot to help you write a paper or create a study guide, follow these steps:\nAssistance writing a paper:\n1. Organize your thoughts and ideas about your topic.\n2. Ask the chatbot for an outline of a paper about your topic.\n3. Compare your ideas with the chatbot's suggestions and have a conversation with the bot about your paper. Treat the bot like an assistant.\n4. Ask the chatbot for opposing views and consider both sides of the argument.\n5. Write your paper on your own, fact-checking any information provided by the bot and citing your sources.\n6.

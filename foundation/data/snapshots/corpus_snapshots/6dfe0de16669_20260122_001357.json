We'll be your guide, demystifying AI and exploring its many practical applications, whether you want to use these powerful tools or learn more.\nWhat is AI?\nAI enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. You’ve probably used AI without realizing it—like when your streaming service recommends shows, your shopping site suggests products, or your phone predicts text as you type.\nWhat Makes AI Different Now?\nAI has been around for years, but in November 2022, OpenAI made ChatGPT widely available. This marked a shift because ChatGPT is a generative AI tool—it doesn’t just analyze data; it creates new content based on what you input.\nThe Basics of Prompts\nInteracting with generative AI tools like ChatGPT involves entering prompts (questions or instructions) and receiving responses (the AI’s generated output).\nTypes of Basic Prompts\n- Question Prompt – Ask a question, and the AI provides an answer (e.g., What causes lightning?).\n- Instruction Prompt – Give a command, and the AI performs a task (e.g., Create a 45-minute lesson plan on climate change).\nWatch this 90-second video to see this in action.\nA short video guiding viewers through basic generative AI prompts\nHow AI Works\nAI tools are trained on vast amounts of information from the internet. Using complex algorithms, they predict and generate responses that mimic human conversation. These tools belong to a category called large language models (LLMs). Watch our 90-second explainer video for more info.\nA brief explainer about Generative AI\nWhat AI Can Do\nGenerative AI tools can:\n- Assist with writing (clarify, summarize, or generate content)\n- Spark ideas\n- Explain topics or serve as a tutor\n- Summarize articles, videos, or audio\n- Help shift focus from routine tasks to higher-level thinking\nAI Concerns & Limitations\nWhile AI is a powerful tool with many benefits, it also comes with challenges and ethical concerns. Understanding these can help you use AI responsibly. Here are some key issues to keep in mind:\n- Data Privacy – Be cautious about sharing personal or proprietary information; some AI models may use inputs for further training.\n- Inaccuracy (Hallucinations) – AI sometimes generates incorrect or misleading information that sounds plausible.\n- Biases – Since AI learns from internet data, it can reflect existing biases.\n- Ethical Issues – AI tools are trained on content scraped from the web, often without permission from creators. Lawsuits regarding copyright violations are ongoing.\n- Accessibility - Not all AI tools are built to be accessible for people with disabilities.\n- Environmental Impact – AI models require vast computing power and consume significant electricity and water.\n- Human Labor – AI moderation sometimes relies on underpaid workers who review harmful content, sometimes at personal cost.\nWhich AI Tool to Try?\nSince ChatGPT’s release, many other generative AI text tools have emerged.

Here is a rough draft. Could you please make the text clearer, more concise, and organized?” I then pasted into ChatGPT the text of my draft. When ChatGPT came back with a response, I pasted the ChatGPT version back into a Google Doc and I revised it. The AI had made some of my text too concise so important meaning was lost.

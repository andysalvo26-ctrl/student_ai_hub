Augment an existing business model with AI.\n- Customer Proxy. Achieve customer outcomes through predefined processes executed by AI.\n- Modular Creator. Use AI to assemble reusable modules (including third parties) to assist in achieving customer outcomes, with no predetermined process.\n- Orchestrator.

A recent research brief from the MIT Center for Information Systems Research outlined how business models are evolving to keep pace with advances in artificial intelligence, and what it takes to successfully navigate change.\nThe original digital business models\nTo understand new business models for the AI era, it helps to unpack the old ones first. In 2013, MIT CISR researchers and identified four digital business models:\n- Supplier companies, which sell products through third parties, like manufacturers.\n- Omnichannel companies, which have a digital and physical presence, such as retailers and banks.\n- Modular Producers, which offer plug-and-play products or services, such as payment service providers.\n- Ecosystem Drivers, which offer a go-to destination in a given customer domain (e.g., housing) and connect customers with providers.\nThese models have seen significant shifts in the past 12 years, with companies that lead or otherwise participate in a digital ecosystem becoming far more prevalent than traditional brick-and-mortar sellers. Focusing on firms’ dominant models, supplier and omnichannel business models are much less prevalent today, while companies with ecosystem driver business models have grown from 12% of businesses in 2013 to 58% of businesses in 2025. In large part, this is because these companies were the only ones of the four to exceed industry-average revenue growth.\nThese shifts, coupled with rapid adoption of AI in all its forms — machine learning plus agentic, generative, and robotic AI — prompted the development of a new business model framework.\n4 business models for the AI era\nFor the update, Weill, Woerner, and colleagues and Gayan Benedict used survey data obtained from 2,378 companies between 2013 and 2025 to organize business models into four new categories.

In this case, a financial services company could set parameters to automatically manage a customer’s investment portfolio.\n- Modular Creator: Much like producers of plug-and-play products, these firms use AI to assemble reusable modules (including those from third parties) into tailored service bundles. Applying this model, a financial services company could create and recommend a bundle of investment, insurance, and credit products that align with a customer’s goals.\n- Orchestrator: These firms achieve customer outcomes (within guardrails) by using AI to assemble an ecosystem of complementary products and services.

She studies how large enterprises transform for success in the digital economy, with a focus on digital partnering, value creation, and value capture in digital models. Stephanie Woerner is a principal research scientist at MIT Sloan and the director of MIT CISR. She studies how companies use technology and data to make more effective business models, as well as how they manage associated organizational change, governance, and strategy implications.

# Student AI Hub — Foundation Briefing

## What this is

This repository documents how the foundation of the Student AI Hub was built. The Student AI Hub is a collection of reference materials about artificial intelligence designed for students. This repository contains the tools, documentation, and five reference sections that were created during the initial build phase. It serves as a record of the methodology used to create citation-grounded reference materials from approved sources.

## What this repository represents

This repository documents and implements the process used to build the initial foundation of the Student AI Hub. It contains the initial set of reference materials and the process used to create them. The Student AI Hub began with this documented process to create its first reference sections.

The repository contains the tools, scripts, documentation, and reference materials from that initial build phase. It serves as both a historical record and a reference for understanding how sources were selected, how content was organized, and how reference sections were written and reviewed.

This repository represents the foundation only. The Student AI Hub may include additional content that was not created through this process. Future content may be added through other means, including direct human authoring or different workflows.

## What was produced

Through the process documented in this repository, the following foundational elements were created:

- **Five reference sections**: Clear, organized reference materials covering:
  - AI Basics
  - Using AI for School and Work
  - How Businesses Are Using AI
  - AI Tools You Might Use
  - Rules, Risks, and Ethics of AI

- **A documented build process**: Clear documentation explaining how sources were selected, how content was organized, and how reference sections were created and reviewed.

- **A source list used for the foundation**: A registry containing 36 approved URLs, each selected by a person and classified by section and source type. This registry defines the initial set of sources used to build the foundational reference sections.

## How the foundation was built (6 steps)

**Step 1: Decide what the hub would cover**

The first step was defining clear sections that would organize the reference materials. These sections included topics like AI basics, using AI for school and work, how businesses use AI, AI tools students might encounter, and rules and risks related to AI. The structure was decided before any content was created.

**Step 2: Choose sources deliberately**

People selected a limited set of sources to use for building the reference sections. These sources were chosen intentionally based on credibility, relevance, and appropriateness for students. Each source was reviewed and approved by a person before it was added to the list.

**Step 3: Organize sources into sections**

Each approved source was placed into one of the predefined sections and labeled by type. This organization helped keep topics focused and prevented sources from being used in multiple sections where they might not fit well.

**Step 4: Collect the content from those sources**

The text from approved sources was gathered so it could be reviewed and organized. If a source could not be accessed—for example, if a website blocked access or required payment—the content was not guessed or filled in. Only content that could actually be accessed was used.

**Step 5: Turn sources into reference material**

The collected material was used to draft clear reference pages for students. These drafts were written to explain AI concepts, tools, and considerations in plain language. The drafts were then reviewed to check for accuracy, balance, and clarity. When issues were found, the language was revised to be more precise or to better reflect the source material.

**Step 6: Lock the initial reference sections**

The first set of reference pages was finalized and treated as the initial foundation of the Student AI Hub. These pages are marked as "locked" to indicate that they have been reviewed and finalized. They represent the completed initial foundation that was built through this documented process.

## What students can read

Students can read five reference sections that were produced as part of the foundation. These sections are available as PDFs in:

`foundation/docs/00_briefing_packet/02_outputs/pdfs/`

The sections are:

- **AI Basics** (`ai-basics.pdf`) — Core concepts and definitions explaining how AI and machine learning work.

- **Using AI for School and Work** (`using-ai-for-school-and-work.pdf`) — Practical guidance for students using AI in coursework and productivity.

- **How Businesses Are Using AI** (`how-businesses-use-ai.pdf`) — High-level explanation of current business applications of AI.

- **AI Tools You Might Use** (`ai-tools-you-might-use.pdf`) — Categories of AI tools students may encounter, without endorsement.

- **Rules, Risks, and Ethics of AI** (`rules-risks-ethics.pdf`) — Ethical, legal, and governance considerations surrounding AI.

These sections are reference materials. They can be read in any order or consulted as needed.

## What this is not

- **Not the full Student AI Hub**: This repository contains the foundation and initial reference sections, but the Student AI Hub may include additional content created through other means.

- **Not an AI tool or chatbot**: This repository documents a process for creating reference materials. It does not provide conversational interfaces or answer questions in real time.

- **Not a live or ongoing system**: This repository is a record of how the foundation was built. It is not a running application or service that students interact with directly.

- **Not a replacement for coursework**: The reference sections provide background information but do not substitute for classes, assignments, or instructor guidance.

- **Not updated automatically**: The sections were created as part of the initial foundation and are marked as "locked." They represent the state of information at the time they were created and reviewed.

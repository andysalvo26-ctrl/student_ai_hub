# Registry Snapshot Artifacts (Foundation)

## Purpose

These CSV files document the lifecycle of source URLs used to build the Student AI Hub foundation corpus. They provide a historical record of which URLs were collected, which were successfully processed, and which were actually used in the published reference sections.

## Snapshot Definitions

### legacy_collected_links_v0.csv

The original set of URLs collected during initial sourcing (36 total). This file preserves the complete initial collection unchanged as a historical record. It represents all URLs that were selected and approved for use in building the foundation, regardless of whether they were successfully processed or used.

### active_ingested_links_v1.csv

URLs that were successfully scraped and chunked into the corpus (29 total). These URLs are evidenced by their presence in `foundation/data/chunks/chunks.jsonl`. A URL appears in this snapshot if its content was successfully retrieved, processed, and broken into citable chunks that were added to the corpus.

### active_used_in_final_sections_v1.csv

URLs whose content was actually referenced in the published foundation reference sections (22 total). These URLs are traceable via chunk IDs referenced in `foundation/content/sections/**/index.md` back to URLs through chunk metadata. A URL appears in this snapshot if at least one of its chunks was cited in a published reference section.

## Relationships Between Snapshots

The three snapshots form a nested hierarchy:

- `active_used_in_final_sections_v1.csv` ⊆ `active_ingested_links_v1.csv` ⊆ `legacy_collected_links_v0.csv`

Not all collected links were successfully ingested (7 links were collected but not ingested). Not all ingested links were used in final sections (7 links were ingested but not used in final sections). No inference is made about quality, relevance, or intent based on non-use.

## Evidence Sources

These snapshots were derived from the following authoritative repository artifacts:

- **Chunks data**: `foundation/data/chunks/chunks.jsonl`
- **Published sections**: `foundation/content/sections/**/index.md`
- **Computed lists**: 
  - `foundation/scripts/sheets/ingested_urls.json`
  - `foundation/scripts/sheets/used_in_final_sections_urls.json`

The snapshots were generated by the registry audit script (`foundation/scripts/sheets/audit_registry.js`) and exported from the Google Sheet registry.

## Non-goals and Limits

- These files do not explain why a link was or was not ingested or used in final sections.
- These files do not add new sources to the registry.
- These files do not imply ongoing updates or maintenance.
- These files represent a point-in-time snapshot of the foundation build process.
- These files do not make claims about source quality, accuracy, or trustworthiness.

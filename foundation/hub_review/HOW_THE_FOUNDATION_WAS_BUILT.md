# How the Foundation Was Built

## Step 1: Decide What the Hub Would Cover

The first step was defining clear sections that would organize the reference materials. These sections included topics like AI basics, using AI for school and work, how businesses use AI, AI tools students might encounter, and rules and risks related to AI. The structure was decided before any content was created. This helped ensure that each section had a clear purpose and that topics would not overlap or drift into unrelated areas.

## Step 2: Choose Sources Deliberately

People selected a limited set of sources to use for building the reference sections. These sources were chosen intentionally based on credibility, relevance, and appropriateness for students. Sources were not pulled automatically from the internet or gathered through web searches. Instead, each source was reviewed and approved by a person before it was added to the list. This deliberate selection process ensured that only appropriate, reliable sources were used.

## Step 3: Organize Sources Into Sections

Each approved source was placed into one of the predefined sections and labeled by type. For example, a source might be labeled as "University / Official" or "Explainer / Guide" to indicate what kind of material it was. This organization helped keep topics focused and prevented sources from being used in multiple sections where they might not fit well. It also made it clear which sources belonged to which topic area.

## Step 4: Collect the Content From Those Sources

The text from approved sources was gathered so it could be reviewed and organized. This involved accessing the sources and saving their content in a structured way. If a source could not be accessed—for example, if a website blocked access or required payment—the content was not guessed or filled in. Instead, the source was marked as unavailable and the process moved on. Only content that could actually be accessed was used.

## Step 5: Turn Sources Into Reference Material

The collected material was used to draft clear reference pages for students. These drafts were written to explain AI concepts, tools, and considerations in plain language. The drafts were then reviewed to check for accuracy, balance, and clarity. When issues were found, the language was revised to be more precise or to better reflect the source material. This review and revision process happened before any pages were finalized.

## Step 6: Lock the Initial Reference Sections

The first set of reference pages was finalized and treated as the initial foundation of the Student AI Hub. These pages serve as starting material that students can use to learn about AI. They are marked as "locked" to indicate that they have been reviewed and finalized. This does not mean they can never change, but it does mean they represent the completed initial foundation that was built through this documented process.

## What This Process Produced

Through this process, the following were created:

- **Five reference sections**: Clear, organized reference materials covering AI basics, using AI for school and work, how businesses use AI, AI tools students might encounter, and rules and risks related to AI.

- **A documented build process**: Clear documentation explaining how sources were selected, how content was organized, and how reference sections were created and reviewed.

- **A clear starting point for the Student AI Hub**: An initial foundation that establishes structure, standards, and reference materials that can be referenced, extended, or built upon as the hub grows.

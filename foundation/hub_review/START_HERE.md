## What the Student AI Hub Is

The Student AI Hub is a collection of reference materials about artificial intelligence designed for students. It provides clear, organized explanations of AI concepts, tools, and considerations that students might encounter in their coursework or future careers. The hub focuses on plain-language explanations with citations to approved sources, making it easier for students to understand AI without wading through marketing materials or conflicting information.

## What This Repository Represents

This repository documents how the foundation of the Student AI Hub was built. Think of it as the groundwork—the initial set of reference materials and the process used to create them. Just as a building needs a foundation before it can grow, the Student AI Hub started with this documented process to create its first reference sections. This repository contains the tools, documentation, and reference materials from that initial build phase.

## What This Review Folder Is For

This folder translates the technical build process into plain language for students and other non-technical readers. It explains how the foundation was created—how sources were selected, how content was organized, and how the reference sections were written and reviewed. This folder describes the process used to build the initial foundation, not how the entire hub works today or how it might work in the future.

## What This Repository Does Not Represent

- **Not the full hub**: This repository contains the foundation and initial reference sections, but the Student AI Hub may include additional content created through other means.

- **Not an AI tool or chatbot**: This repository documents a process for creating reference materials. It does not provide conversational interfaces or answer questions in real time.

- **Not a live or ongoing system**: This repository is a record of how the foundation was built. It is not a running application or service that students interact with directly.

- **Not a description of future plans**: This repository documents what was done to create the foundation. It does not describe what the hub might become or what features might be added later.

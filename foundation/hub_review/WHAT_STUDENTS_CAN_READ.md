# What Students Can Read

## The Reference Sections

The foundation work produced a small set of reference sections that explain AI topics clearly and in plain language. These sections are written to help students understand artificial intelligence concepts, tools, and considerations they might encounter in their coursework or future careers.

The sections are:

- **AI Basics**: Core concepts and definitions explaining how AI and machine learning work.

- **Using AI for School and Work**: Practical guidance for students using AI in coursework and productivity.

- **How Businesses Are Using AI**: High-level explanation of current business applications of AI.

- **AI Tools You Might Use**: Categories of AI tools students may encounter, without endorsement.

- **Rules, Risks, and Ethics of AI**: Ethical, legal, and governance considerations surrounding AI.

These sections are meant to be read like reference material, not like a class or a textbook. You can read them in any order, skip sections that don't apply to you, or return to them when you need clarification on a specific topic.

## Where to Find Them

The sections are available as PDFs in this folder:

- `hub_review/WHAT_STUDENTS_CAN_READ/PDFs/`

These PDFs were copied from the main repository where they were originally created. They are the same reference materials that were built as part of the Student AI Hub foundation.

## How to Use These Materials

Students can read these sections independently, whenever they need background information or clarification about AI topics. The sections can be used to understand concepts before class, to clarify something you've heard about, or to get a basic overview of a topic you're encountering for the first time.

These materials are not assignments, requirements, or official policy. They are reference materials that you can use as needed. They do not replace your coursework, your instructor's guidance, or your own judgment about how to use AI tools.

## What These Materials Are Not

- **Not a replacement for coursework**: These sections provide background information but do not substitute for your classes, assignments, or instructor guidance.

- **Not personalized advice**: The sections offer general information, not advice tailored to your specific situation, major, or career goals.

- **Not real-time or interactive**: These are static reference documents. They do not answer questions, provide updates, or adapt to your needs.

- **Not updated automatically**: The sections were created as part of the initial foundation and are marked as "locked." They represent the state of information at the time they were created and reviewed.

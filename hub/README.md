# Student AI Hub — Hub Repository

This is the scaling layer for the Student AI Hub (not yet implemented).

## Purpose

This directory will contain future extensions to the Student AI Hub, including:

- Website infrastructure
- Expanded content sections
- Additional workflows and tools
- Integration with foundation materials

## Important Notes

- **This is not the foundation**: The foundation repository (`foundation/`) contains the frozen methodology, reference sections, and audit trail. This hub directory does not replace it.

- **Future work**: Content and features added here may reference or build upon foundation materials but operate independently.

- **Status**: This directory is currently empty and reserved for future scaling work.

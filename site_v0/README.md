# Site v0 — Student AI Hub Reference Site

## Purpose

This folder contains the initial version of the Student AI Hub reference site. The site provides plain, institutional reference materials about artificial intelligence for students.

## Structure

- `wix/home-embed/` — Wix embed component for the home page
  - `src/` — Source files (modular HTML, CSS, JSON, JS)
  - `dist/` — Built output (self-contained HTML file)
  - `prompts/` — Documentation and prompts for development

## Content Sources

Content for this site is derived from the foundation repository (`foundation/`). No new factual claims are introduced here. Placeholders indicate where canonical content will be integrated.

## Development Notes

- The `dist/home.html` file is self-contained (inline CSS and JS) for Wix embedding
- The `src/` version is modular for development and maintenance
- All content must be plain, institutional, and non-promotional
- No factual claims about AI, Penn State, Smeal, or the foundation beyond what exists in the foundation repository

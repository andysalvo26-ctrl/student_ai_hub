The Smeal Student AI Hub is a student-led reference site curated by the Applied AI Club at Penn State. It brings together clear, source-based information about artificial intelligence.

​

The hub is designed to help students understand what AI is, how it is used, and what issues come with it.

The Penn State Smeal College of Business prepares students to make informed decisions and act with integrity. It emphasizes analytical thinking, ethical judgment, and understanding real-world business problems.

The Student AI Hub supports these goals by helping students learn how AI affects business, education, and professional work. The focus is on understanding, not promotion.

The Applied AI Club at Penn State maintains this site.

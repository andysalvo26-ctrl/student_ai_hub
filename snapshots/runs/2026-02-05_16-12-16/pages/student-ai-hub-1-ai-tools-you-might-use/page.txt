This page is presented as a demonstration of how content in the Learn section will be structured as the Student AI Hub continues to develop.

​

When complete, this section will outline categories of AI tools students may encounter, along with high-level explanations of their intended use and constraints. The focus will be on understanding capabilities and tradeoffs, not on directing usage. The AI Basics page serves as a full reference for how Learn pages will be developed and reviewed.

AI tools are increasingly used in academic and professional settings. Students may encounter them while studying, writing, coding, analyzing data, or organizing information for work.

​

This section describes common ways AI shows up in school and workplace contexts. It focuses on how these tools are typically used, what they are capable of, and where careful judgment is needed, rather than offering instructions or recommendations.

​

## Common Ways AI is Used

In school and work environments, AI tools are often used to support tasks that involve language, information processing, or pattern recognition.

Common uses include:

generating or refining written text

generating or refining written text

summarizing readings or documents

summarizing readings or documents

assisting with coding or debugging

assisting with coding or debugging

organizing notes or outlining ideas

organizing notes or outlining ideas

analyzing large amounts of information

analyzing large amounts of information

In many cases, AI is used to speed up routine work or to help users get unstuck when starting a task. The tools themselves do not understand the goals of an assignment or the expectations of an instructor or employer.

## AI as Support, not Replacement

In both academic and professional settings, AI is typically used as a support tool rather than a replacement for human judgment.

​

While AI systems can generate text, suggestions, or code, they do not understand context in the way people do. They rely on patterns from existing data and may produce outputs that sound confident but are incomplete, misleading, or incorrect.

​

As a result, AI-generated material usually requires review, interpretation, and revision by a person before it is appropriate for use in school or work.

## Accuracy and Reliability

AI tools can produce errors, make incorrect assumptions, or generate information that appears credible but is not accurate. This is especially common when tools are asked to explain complex topics, summarize unfamiliar material, or provide sources.

Because of this, AI output is often treated as a starting point rather than a final answer. Information generated by AI typically needs to be checked against course materials, original sources, or other reliable references.

## Academic and Professional Expectations

Expectations around AI use vary widely across classes, disciplines, workplaces, and organizations.

In academic settings, instructors may have different policies or expectations regarding whether and how AI tools can be used. In professional settings, organizations may have guidelines related to confidentiality, data use, or acceptable applications of AI.

Understanding these expectations usually requires consulting:

course syllabi or assignment instructions

AI tools do not account for these expectations on their own.

Some AI tools store user inputs or use them to improve their systems. This can raise concerns when working with sensitive, personal, or confidential information.

​

In school and work contexts, this may include:

unpublished research or assignments

personal data

proprietary or organizational information

For this reason, the type of information entered into an AI tool can matter as much as the task the tool is used for.

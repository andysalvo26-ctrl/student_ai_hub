AI at Penn State

This page is presented as a demonstration of how content in the Learn section will be structured as the Student AI Hub continues to develop.

When complete, this section will summarize Penn State–specific guidance, policies, and resources related to artificial intelligence. Content will focus on institutional context rather than advice, helping students locate official information and understand how AI is addressed across the university. The AI Basics page serves as a reference for the structure and standards future Learn pages will follow.

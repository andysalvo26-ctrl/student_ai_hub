AI News That Matters

This page is presented as a demonstration of how content in the Learn section will be structured as the Student AI Hub continues to develop.

When complete, this section will highlight AI news that materially affects how the technology is governed, deployed, and understood. Coverage will prioritize high-impact developments over fast-moving headlines, helping readers distinguish meaningful shifts from short-term hype. Refer to the AI Basics page for a complete example of the intended structure and sourcing.

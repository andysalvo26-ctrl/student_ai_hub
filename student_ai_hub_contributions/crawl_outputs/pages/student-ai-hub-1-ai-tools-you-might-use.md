AI Tools You Might Use

This page is presented as a demonstration of how content in the Learn section will be structured as the Student AI Hub continues to develop.

When complete, this section will outline categories of AI tools students may encounter, along with high-level explanations of their intended use and constraints. The focus will be on understanding capabilities and tradeoffs, not on directing usage. The AI Basics page serves as a full reference for how Learn pages will be developed and reviewed.

Rules, Risks, and Ethics of AI

This page explains the expectations around using artificial intelligence in academic and professional settings.

Rather than focusing on specific tools, it looks at how AI use relates to academic integrity, fairness, accountability, and risk. The goal is to help students understand not just what AI systems can do, but what responsible use looks like in practice.

As the Student AI Hub continues to develop, this page will expand with clearer examples, relevant policies, and practical guidance that applies across the site. It serves as a shared reference point for how AI is discussed, evaluated, and used throughout the Hub.

# Contributing to AI News That Matters

The "AI News That Matters" section of the Student AI Hub collects brief, curated summaries of recent developments in artificial intelligence that may be relevant to college students. Entries describe what happened, explain why it might matter to students, and acknowledge what remains unclear.

Contributions come from students and faculty who want to help their peers stay informed. The goal is to surface a small number of developments worth knowing about—explained plainly and without exaggeration.

## How to Get Started

1. **Review the sample entry** included below. Read it closely, paying attention to its structure, tone, and the kind of detail it includes.

2. **Find a recent article** from a reputable source—major newspapers, established technology publications, or credible academic outlets.

3. **Read carefully with the sample in mind.** As you read, think about what actually happened, why a student at Penn State might find it relevant, and what questions remain unanswered.

4. **Include this guide as context** when drafting with ChatGPT or another AI assistant. This helps the assistant understand the expected format and tone.

5. **Draft with AI as an assistant, not a replacement.** Read what it produces, revise it, and make sure the final version sounds like something you would be comfortable putting your name on.

Contributors should follow any applicable course or assignment policies regarding AI use.

- **Why It Matters to Students** — A short explanation of relevance to someone studying or preparing to enter the workforce.

# Contributing to AI News That Matters

The "AI News That Matters" section of the Student AI Hub collects brief, curated summaries of recent developments in artificial intelligence that may be relevant to college students. Entries describe what happened, explain why it might matter to students, and acknowledge what remains unclear.

Contributions come from students and faculty who want to help their peers stay informed. The goal is to surface developments worth knowing about—explained plainly and without exaggeration.

## How to Get Started

Begin by reviewing the sample entry included below. Read it closely, paying attention to its structure, tone, and the kind of detail it includes.

When you are ready to write your own entry, find a recent article from a reputable source—major newspapers, established technology publications, or credible academic outlets. Read the article carefully with the sample in mind, focusing on what actually happened, why a student at Penn State might find it relevant, and what questions remain unanswered.

If you find AI assistants helpful for drafting, include this guide as context so the assistant understands the expected format and tone. Use the assistant as a collaborator, not a replacement for your own judgment. Read what it produces, revise it, and make sure the final version reflects your understanding of the source material.

Contributors should follow any applicable course or assignment policies regarding AI use.

## Entry Structure

**Headline** — A short, descriptive headline that names the development without editorializing.

# Sample AI News Entry

**Headline**

AI Companies and AI-Powered Products Feature Prominently in Super Bowl Advertising

**Source**

*AP News*, February 2026

**What Happened**

Several companies used Super Bowl 60 to advertise AI-related products and services, marking the second consecutive year that AI appeared as a prominent theme in Super Bowl advertising. Ads featured AI-enabled consumer devices, AI-powered software tools, and creative work produced with AI assistance. OpenAI also purchased ad time for a spot that had not yet been revealed. With 30-second units averaging $8 million, these placements represent significant marketing investments aimed at broad consumer audiences.

**Why It Matters to Students**

Super Bowl advertising reflects which industries are investing heavily in brand visibility. The presence of AI companies and AI-themed ads suggests these firms see value in reaching mainstream consumers, not just enterprise buyers. For students studying marketing or strategy, this signals where companies are allocating significant budgets and how emerging technologies are being positioned for general audiences.

**What to Watch Next**

It remains to be seen how viewers respond to AI-focused ads and whether this advertising translates into consumer adoption or brand awareness. The content of OpenAI's ad has not yet been revealed, which may offer additional insight into how AI companies are choosing to present themselves to the public.

## A Note on Submissions

All submissions are reviewed before publication. Entries may be lightly edited for clarity, consistency, or length. Not every submission will be published—some stories may be too similar to recent entries, too speculative for responsible summary, or outside the scope of what the section covers.

The Student AI Hub appreciates every contribution.

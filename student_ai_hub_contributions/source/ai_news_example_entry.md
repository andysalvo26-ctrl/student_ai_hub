**What Happened**

Several companies used Super Bowl 60 to advertise AI-related products and services, marking the second consecutive year that AI appeared as a prominent theme in Super Bowl advertising. Ads featured AI-enabled consumer devices, AI-powered software tools, and creative work produced with AI assistance. OpenAI also purchased ad time for a spot that had not yet been revealed. With 30-second units averaging $8 million, these placements represent significant marketing investments aimed at broad consumer audiences.

**Why It Matters to Students**

Super Bowl advertising reflects which industries are investing heavily in brand visibility. The presence of AI companies and AI-themed ads suggests these firms see value in reaching mainstream consumers, not just enterprise buyers. For students studying marketing or strategy, this signals where companies are allocating significant budgets and how emerging technologies are being positioned for general audiences.

**What to Watch Next**

It remains to be seen how viewers respond to AI-focused ads and whether this advertising translates into consumer adoption or brand awareness. The content of OpenAI's ad has not yet been revealed, which may offer additional insight into how AI companies are choosing to present themselves to the public.

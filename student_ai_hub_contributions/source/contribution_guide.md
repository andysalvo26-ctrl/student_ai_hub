# Contributing to AI News That Matters

The "AI News That Matters" section of the Student AI Hub collects brief, curated summaries of recent developments in artificial intelligence that may be relevant to college students. Entries describe what happened, explain why it might matter to students, and acknowledge what remains unclear.

Contributions come from students and faculty who want to help their peers stay informed. The goal is to surface developments worth knowing about—explained plainly and without exaggeration.

## How to Get Started

Begin by reviewing the sample entry included below. Read it closely, paying attention to its structure, tone, and the kind of detail it includes.

When you are ready to write your own entry, find a recent article from a reputable source—major newspapers, established technology publications, or credible academic outlets. Read the article carefully with the sample in mind, focusing on what actually happened, why a student at Penn State might find it relevant, and what questions remain unanswered.

If you find AI assistants helpful for drafting, include this guide as context so the assistant understands the expected format and tone. Use the assistant as a collaborator, not a replacement for your own judgment. Read what it produces, revise it, and make sure the final version reflects your understanding of the source material.

Contributors should follow any applicable course or assignment policies regarding AI use.

## Entry Structure

**Headline** — A short, descriptive headline that names the development without editorializing.

**Source** — The publication name and date.

**What Happened** — A brief summary of the facts as reported. Synthesize rather than list. Tie facts to business implications where relevant.

**Why It Matters to Students** — A short explanation of relevance to someone studying or preparing to enter the workforce.

**What to Watch Next** — One or two sentences acknowledging what is not yet known or what might change.

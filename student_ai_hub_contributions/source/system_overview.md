# AI News That Matters — How Contributions Work

This document describes how the "AI News That Matters" section of the Student AI Hub accepts and reviews contributions from Penn State students and faculty.

---

## What This Section Is

"AI News That Matters" is a curated collection of brief summaries about recent developments in artificial intelligence. Each entry describes what happened, explains why it may be relevant to students, and acknowledges what remains uncertain.

The section is maintained by editors from the Applied AI Club. Contributions come from anyone at Penn State with an interest in AI and a @psu.edu email address.

## How Submissions Work

Contributors read a short guide before submitting. The guide explains what kind of entries fit the section, how to structure a submission, and includes a sample entry for reference.

Submissions are collected through a Google Form. The form asks for:

- The contributor's name, email, year, and whether they are an Applied AI Club member
- A link to the source article, along with the publication name and date
- The entry itself: a headline, a summary of what happened, why it matters to students, and what to watch next
- How the contributor would like to be credited if published

Responses are stored in a shared Google Sheet that editors can access.

## How Editors Review Submissions

Editors review incoming submissions and decide how to proceed. Options include:

- Publishing the submission with light edits for clarity
- Drafting a revised version and sending it back to the contributor for review before publishing
- Declining the submission and notifying the contributor with brief feedback

Editors may use AI tools to help with drafting, but final decisions about what to publish are made by people.

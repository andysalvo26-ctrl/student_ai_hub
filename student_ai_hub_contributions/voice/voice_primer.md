# Student AI Hub Voice Primer

This document describes the writing norms used across the Student AI Hub. It is intended to help contributors and editors produce content that feels consistent with the Hub's existing materials.

The Hub's voice is calm, clear, and student-readable. It explains rather than instructs. It makes uncertainty visible rather than hiding it. It treats AI as a tool that supports human judgment, not a replacement for it.

## What the Voice Sounds Like

The Student AI Hub writes for undergraduate students and faculty who want to understand AI without wading through hype or jargon. The tone is academic but not stiff. Paragraphs are short. Claims are grounded.

The Hub describes what AI systems do, where they appear, and what their limits are. It does not tell readers what to think or how to feel. It does not predict the future or make bold claims about what AI will become.

When something is uncertain, the writing says so. Words like "may," "often," "can," and "typically" appear frequently. This is intentional.

## Do

- Write in short, clear paragraphs
- Use plain language that an undergraduate can follow
- Describe what AI systems do, not what they "could" or "will" do
- Acknowledge limits, tradeoffs, and uncertainty
- Position AI as a support for human judgment
- Ground claims in sources or observable patterns
- Let the structure do the work—clear headings, logical flow
- Write as if explaining to a curious peer, not selling to a skeptic

## Avoid

- Hype, superlatives, or breathless language ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- Predictions about the future of AI
- Telling readers what to think or do
- Long paragraphs or dense blocks of text
- Jargon without explanation
- Oversimplifying complex ideas to the point of distortion
- Language that sounds like marketing or policy enforcement
- Leading with what something is *not* (negative framing)

## Micro Examples

### Good

> AI tools can produce errors, make incorrect assumptions, or generate information that appears credible but is not accurate. This is especially common when tools are asked to explain complex topics, summarize unfamiliar material, or provide sources. Because of this, AI output is often treated as a starting point rather than a final answer.

This paragraph is calm, specific, and honest about limits. It uses hedging language appropriately. It does not tell the reader what to do—it describes how AI is commonly treated.

### Too Bloggy

> AI is completely changing the game for students! These powerful tools can help you write faster, study smarter, and get ahead in your career. But be careful—they're not perfect, and you'll want to double-check everything before you hit submit.

This paragraph is informal, exclamatory, and promotional. It makes vague claims ("changing the game") and talks directly to the reader in a sales-y way. It would feel out of place on the Hub.

## A Note on Tone

The Hub's writing is serious without being heavy. It respects the reader's intelligence. It assumes students want clarity, not persuasion.

When in doubt, describe. Let the facts speak. Keep it short.
